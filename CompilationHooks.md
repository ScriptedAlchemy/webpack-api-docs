### `compilation.hooks.buildModule`

The `compilation.hooks.buildModule` is a [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#8922%2C10-8922%2C10) provided by the Webpack [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#422%2C13-422%2C13) class. This hook is called when a module is about to be built. It allows you to run custom logic or modify the module before the build process starts.

### How to Use It

To use the `buildModule` hook, you need to tap into it using the `tap` method. This is typically done within a Webpack plugin.

### Example

Here is an example of how to use the `buildModule` hook in a custom Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyCustomPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.buildModule.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (module) => {
        console.log('Building module:', module.resource);
        // Add custom logic here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyCustomPlugin;
```

### How It Works

When Webpack starts building a module, it triggers the `buildModule` hook. Any functions tapped into this hook will be executed with the module as an argument. This allows you to inspect or modify the module before the build process continues.

### What It's For

The `buildModule` hook is useful for:

- Logging or debugging information about modules being built.
- Modifying module properties or adding custom metadata.
- Implementing custom build logic that needs to run before a module is built.

### Parameters

### `compilation.hooks.failedEntry`

#### What it's for
The `failedEntry` hook in the `compilation` object is used to handle scenarios where an entry point fails to be added to the compilation. This can be useful for logging errors, performing cleanup, or triggering other actions when an entry point addition fails.

#### How it works
The `failedEntry` hook is a [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1692%2C17-1692%2C17) that gets called with three parameters: the entry dependency, the entry options, and the error that caused the failure. This allows you to react to the failure of adding an entry point by accessing detailed information about the failure.

#### How to use it
To use the `failedEntry` hook, you need to tap into it using the `tap` method. This method allows you to specify a plugin name and a callback function that will be executed when the hook is called.

#### Example
Here is an example of how to use the `failedEntry` hook to log an error message when an entry point fails to be added:

```javascript
compiler.hooks.compilation.tap("MyPlugin", (compilation) => {
  compilation.hooks.failedEntry.tap("MyPlugin", (entry, options, error) => {
    console.error(`Failed to add entry: ${entry.request}`);
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
  });
});
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts
- **entry**: The entry dependency that failed to be added.
- **options**: The options associated with the entry.
- **error**: The error that caused the failure.

#### Relevant Code
The `failedEntry` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the codebase:

```javascript
1692:1694:types.d.ts
failedEntry: SyncHook<[Dependency, EntryOptions, Error]>;
```

```javascript
629:631:lib/Compilation.js
failedEntry: new SyncHook(["entry", "options", "error"]),
```

This code defines the `failedEntry` hook as a `SyncHook` that takes three parameters: `entry`, `options`, and `error`. This allows you to hook into the entry addition process and perform custom actions or handle errors when an entry fails to be added.

### `compilation.hooks.succeedEntry`

#### What it's for
The `succeedEntry` hook in the [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1694%2C17-1694%2C17) class is used to signal that an entry dependency has been successfully added to the compilation. This hook is useful for plugins or other parts of the webpack system that need to perform actions when an entry has been successfully processed.

#### How it works
The `succeedEntry` hook is a [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1694%2C17-1694%2C17) that gets called with three parameters:
1. `entry` - The entry dependency that was added.
2. `options` - The options associated with the entry.
3. `module` - The module that was created from the entry dependency.

#### Parameters the hook accepts
- **entry**: The entry dependency that was successfully added.
- **options**: The options associated with the entry.
- **module**: The module that was created from the entry dependency.

#### Example usage
Here is an example of how you might tap into the `succeedEntry` hook in a webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.succeedEntry.tap('MyPlugin', (entry, options, module) => {
        console.log('Entry succeeded:', entry, options, module);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Relevant code
The `succeedEntry` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here is the relevant code snippet:

```javascript
629:632:lib/Compilation.js
/** @type {SyncHook<[Dependency, EntryOptions, Error]>} */
failedEntry: new SyncHook(["entry", "options", "error"]),
/** @type {SyncHook<[Dependency, EntryOptions, Module]>} */
succeedEntry: new SyncHook(["entry", "options", "module"]),
```

The hook is called within the `_addEntryItem` method when an entry is successfully added:

```javascript
2280:2284:lib/Compilation.js
this.hooks.succeedEntry.call(
  entry,
  options,
  /** @type {Module} */ (module)
);
```
### `compilation.hooks.dependencyReferencedExports`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.dependencyReferencedExports` is a `SyncWaterfallHook` in the Webpack compilation process. It is used to modify or extend the list of exports referenced by a dependency.

#### How it works:
This hook allows plugins to interact with the list of exports that a dependency references. It provides a way to modify the referenced exports before they are used in the compilation process.

#### Parameters:
- **referencedExports**: An array of referenced exports, which can be either a list of strings or objects containing export details.
- **dependency**: The dependency for which the exports are being referenced.
- **runtime**: The runtime for which the module is analyzed.

#### Usage:
To use this hook, you can tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to use it:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.dependencyReferencedExports.tap(
        'MyPlugin',
        (referencedExports, dependency, runtime) => {
          // Modify the referencedExports as needed
          return referencedExports;
        }
      );
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Example:
Here is a more concrete example that demonstrates how to add a custom export to the list of referenced exports:

```javascript
class AddCustomExportPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('AddCustomExportPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.dependencyReferencedExports.tap(
        'AddCustomExportPlugin',
        (referencedExports, dependency, runtime) => {
          // Add a custom export to the list
          referencedExports.push({
            name: ['customExport'],
            canMangle: false
          });
          return referencedExports;
        }
      );
    });
  }
}

module.exports = AddCustomExportPlugin;
```

#### Relevant Code:
The hook is defined in the `Compilation` class:

```javascript
635:640:lib/Compilation.js
dependencyReferencedExports: new SyncWaterfallHook([
  "referencedExports",
  "dependency",
  "runtime"
]),
```

The `getReferencedExports` method in various dependencies uses this hook to determine the referenced exports:

```javascript
87:139:lib/dependencies/CommonJsExportRequireDependency.js
/**
 * Returns list of exports referenced by this dependency
 * @param {ModuleGraph} moduleGraph module graph

The `processExportInfo` function is used to process export information:

 * @param {boolean} defaultPointsToSelf when true, using default will reference itself
 * @param {Set<ExportInfo>} alreadyVisited already visited export info (to handle circular reexports)
 */
const processExportInfo = (
  runtime,
  referencedExports,

  defaultPointsToSelf = false,
  alreadyVisited = new Set()
) => {
  if (!exportInfo) {
    referencedExports.push(prefix);

#### Summary:
`compilation.hooks.dependencyReferencedExports` is a powerful hook that allows you

 to interact with and modify the list of exports referenced by a dependency during the Webpack compilation process. This provides flexibility and control over how exports are managed and processed.

### `compilation.hooks.executeModule`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.executeModule` is a [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#29%2C20-29%2C20) provided by the Webpack [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#5252%2C14-5252%2C14) class. It is used to tap into the execution of a module during the compilation process.

#### How to use it:
To use this hook, you need to tap into it using the [tap](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/javascript/JavascriptModulesPlugin.js#430%2C57-430%2C57) method provided by the [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#29%2C20-29%2C20) class. This allows you to execute custom logic whenever a module is executed.

#### How it works:
When a module is executed, the [executeModule](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#5248%2C25-5248%2C25) hook is called with two arguments: `ExecuteModuleArgument` and `ExecuteModuleContext`. You can use these arguments to access information about the module being executed and the context in which it is executed.

#### Parameters:
- **ExecuteModuleArgument**: Contains details about the module being executed.
- **ExecuteModuleContext**: Provides the context for the module execution, including assets and chunk information.

#### Example:
Here is an example of how to tap into the [executeModule](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#5248%2C25-5248%2C25) hook:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.executeModule.tap('MyPlugin', (moduleArgument, context) => {
        console.log('Executing module:', moduleArgument.module);
        console.log('Execution context:', context);
        // Add custom logic here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Relevant Code:
The `executeModule` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class and is used in the `executeModule` method. Here are the relevant lines from the codebase:

```javascript
28:29:types/Compilation.d.ts
/** @type {SyncHook<[ExecuteModuleArgument, ExecuteModuleContext]>} */
executeModule: SyncHook<[ExecuteModuleArgument, ExecuteModuleContext]>;
```

```javascript
642:643:lib/Compilation.js
/** @type {AsyncParallelHook<[ExecuteModuleArgument, ExecuteModuleContext]>} */
prepareModuleExecution: new AsyncParallelHook(["options", "context"])
```

```javascript

This hook is particularly useful for plugins that need to perform actions or modifications during the module execution phase of the Webpack compilation process.

### `compilation.hooks.prepareModuleExecution`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.prepareModuleExecution` is an [AsyncParallelHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#31%2C20-31%2C20) provided by the Webpack [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#5252%2C14-5252%2C14) class. It is used to perform asynchronous tasks before a module is executed, allowing custom logic to run in parallel with other tasks before the module execution begins.

#### How to use it:
To use the `prepareModuleExecution` hook, you need to tap into it using one of the available methods: [tap](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/ModuleTemplate.js#76%2C5-76%2C5), [tapAsync](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#143%2C137-143%2C137), or [tapPromise](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#143%2C150-143%2C150). Here is an example of how to use it:

#### Example:
```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.prepareModuleExecution.tapAsync(
        'MyPlugin',
        (executeModuleArgument, executeModuleContext, callback) => {
          console.log('Preparing module execution:', executeModuleArgument, executeModuleContext);
          // Perform any asynchronous operations here
          setTimeout(() => {
            console.log('Asynchronous operation completed');
            callback();
          }, 1000);
        }
      );
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### How it works:
The `prepareModuleExecution` hook is called with two arguments:
1. `executeModuleArgument`: An object containing information about the module to be executed.
2. `executeModuleContext`: An object containing the context in which the module will be executed.

This hook allows you to perform asynchronous operations before the module execution starts. The operations can run in parallel with other tasks, and the module execution will wait until all the hooked functions have completed.

#### What it's for:
The `prepareModuleExecution` hook is useful for scenarios where you need to set up or modify the environment before a module is executed. This can include tasks like loading additional resources, setting up context-specific configurations, or performing any other asynchronous operations that need to be completed before the module runs.

#### Parameters:
- **executeModuleArgument**: An object containing information about the module to be executed.
- **executeModuleContext**: An object containing the context in which the module will be executed.
- **callback**: A callback function that must be called once the asynchronous operation is complete.

#### Relevant Code:

```typescript
30:31:types/Compilation.d.ts
/** @type {AsyncParallelHook<[ExecuteModuleArgument, ExecuteModuleContext]>} */
prepareModuleExecution: AsyncParallelHook<[ExecuteModuleArgument, ExecuteModuleContext]>;
```

```javascript
644:645:lib/Compilation.js
prepareModuleExecution: new AsyncParallelHook(["options", "context"]),
```

This hook is particularly useful for plugins that need to perform actions or modifications during the preparation phase of module execution in the Webpack compilation process.

### `compilation.hooks.finishModules`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.finishModules` is an [AsyncSeriesHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#33%2C20-33%2C20) provided by the Webpack [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#2687%2C43-2687%2C43) class. This hook is called when the compilation process has finished processing all modules. It allows you to perform asynchronous tasks after all modules have been processed but before the compilation is sealed.

#### How to use it:
To use the `finishModules` hook, you need to tap into it using one of the available methods ([tap](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#143%2C129-143%2C129), [tapAsync](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#143%2C137-143%2C137), or [tapPromise](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#143%2C150-143%2C150)). Here is an example of how to use it:

#### Example:
```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.finishModules.tapAsync('MyPlugin', (modules, callback) => {
        console.log('All modules have been processed.');
        callback();
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### How it works:
The `finishModules` hook is defined as an `AsyncSeriesHook` that takes an iterable of modules as its argument. It is called after all modules have been processed, allowing you to perform additional asynchronous operations before the compilation is sealed.

#### What it's for:
The `finishModules` hook is useful for performing tasks that need to be done after all modules have been processed but before the compilation is finalized. This can include tasks like optimizing modules, generating additional assets, or performing custom logging.

#### Parameters:
- **modules**: An iterable of all the modules that have been processed in the compilation.

#### Relevant Code:
The `finishModules` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class:

```typescript
32:33:types/Compilation.d.ts
/** @type {AsyncSeriesHook<[Iterable<Module>]>} */
finishModules: AsyncSeriesHook<[Iterable<Module>]>;
```

It is instantiated in the `Compilation` constructor:

```javascript
645:646:lib/Compilation.js
/** @type {AsyncSeriesHook<[Iterable<Module>]>} */
finishModules: new AsyncSeriesHook(["modules"]),
```

This hook is particularly useful for plugins that need to perform actions or modifications during the final stages of the Webpack compilation process.

### `compilation.hooks.finishRebuildingModule`

#### What it is:
[finishRebuildingModule](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#2313%2C23-2313%2C23) is an [AsyncSeriesHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#33%2C20-33%2C20) provided by the [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#2316%2C32-2316%2C32) class in Webpack. This hook is triggered when a module has finished rebuilding.

#### How to use it:
To use this hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. You can use the [tapAsync](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/test/configCases/rebuild/finishModules/webpack.config.js#16%2C35-16%2C35) method to register an asynchronous callback that will be executed when the hook is called.

#### How it works:
When a module finishes rebuilding, the `finishRebuildingModule` hook is called with the module as an argument. This allows you to perform additional operations or modifications on the module after it has been rebuilt.

#### What it's for:
This hook is useful for plugins that need to perform actions after a module has been rebuilt. For example, you might want to log information, modify the module, or trigger other processes that depend on the module's new state.

#### Example:
Here is an example of how to use the `finishRebuildingModule` hook in a Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.finishRebuildingModule.tapAsync('MyPlugin', (module, callback) => {
        // Perform actions after the module has been rebuilt
        console.log(`Module ${module.identifier()} has been rebuilt.`);
        // Call the callback to indicate that the async operation is complete
        callback();
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Parameters:
- **module**: The module that has finished rebuilding. This is an instance of the `Module` class.
- **callback**: A callback function that must be called when your asynchronous operations are complete.

#### Relevant Code:

```typescript
35:35:types/Compilation.d.ts
finishRebuildingModule: AsyncSeriesHook<[Module]>;
```

```javascript
648:648:lib/Compilation.js
finishRebuildingModule: new AsyncSeriesHook(["module"]),
```

This hook is particularly useful for plugins that need to perform actions or modifications after the module rebuilding phase of the Webpack compilation process.

### `compilation.hooks.unseal`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.unseal` is a [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#29%2C20-29%2C20) provided by the [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#3181%2C35-3181%2C35) class in Webpack. It is used to perform actions when the compilation is "unsealed."

#### How it works:
The `unseal` hook is called when the [unseal](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#2880%2C2-2880%2C2) method of the [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#3181%2C35-3181%2C35) class is invoked. This method is responsible for resetting the state of the compilation, clearing chunks, chunk groups, and other related data structures.

#### What it's for:
The `unseal` hook is useful for plugins or internal processes that need to perform specific actions when the compilation is being reset. This can include cleaning up resources, resetting internal states, or logging information.

#### How to use it:
To use the `unseal` hook, you can tap into it using the [tap](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1781%2C15-1781%2C15) method provided by the [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#29%2C20-29%2C20) class. This allows you to register a callback function that will be executed when the `unseal` method is called.

#### Example:
Here is an example of how to use the `unseal` hook in a Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.unseal.tap('MyPlugin', () => {
        console.log('Compilation is being unsealed.');
        // Perform custom actions here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Parameters:
The `unseal` hook does not provide any parameters to its callback function.

#### Relevant Code:
The `unseal` hook is defined and used in the `Compilation` class as follows:

```javascript
650:652:lib/Compilation.js
unseal: new SyncHook([]),
seal: new SyncHook([]),
```

The `unseal` method, which calls the `unseal` hook, is implemented as follows:

```javascript
2879:2892:lib/Compilation.js
unseal() {
  this.hooks.unseal.call();
  this.chunks.clear();
  this.chunkGroups.length = 0;
  this.namedChunks.clear();
  this.namedChunkGroups.clear();
  this.entrypoints.clear();
  this.additionalChunkAssets.length = 0;
  this.assets = {};
  this.assetsInfo.clear();
  this.moduleGraph.removeAllModuleAttributes();
  this.moduleGraph.unfreeze();
  this.moduleMemCaches2 = undefined;
}
```

This demonstrates how the `unseal` method resets various properties of the `Compilation` object and triggers the `unseal` hook, allowing other parts of the Webpack system or custom plugins to react to this event.

### `compilation.hooks.seal`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.seal` is a [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1777%2C22-1777%2C22) in the Webpack compilation process. It is called when the compilation is about to be sealed, which means that the compilation process is finalizing and no more modules or chunks will be added.

#### How to use it:
To use the `seal` hook, you can tap into it using the [tap](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1781%2C15-1781%2C15) method provided by the [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1777%2C22-1777%2C22) class. This allows you to run custom code at the point in the compilation process when the hook is called.

#### How it works:
The `seal` hook is triggered during the `seal` method of the [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#3181%2C35-3181%2C35) class. This method is responsible for finalizing the compilation, creating chunks, optimizing modules and chunks, and generating assets.

#### What it's for:
The `seal` hook is useful for performing actions that need to occur right before the compilation is finalized. This can include custom optimizations, logging, or modifying the compilation state.

#### Example:
Here is an example of how to tap into the `seal` hook:

```javascript
compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
  compilation.hooks.seal.tap('MyPlugin', () => {
    console.log('The compilation is about to be sealed.');
    // Perform custom actions here
  });
});
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in their callbacks:
The `seal` hook does not provide any parameters to its callbacks.

#### Relevant Code:
The `seal` hook is defined and used in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the codebase:

```javascript
652:654:lib/Compilation.js
seal: new SyncHook([]),
```

The `seal` method where the hook is called:

```javascript
2898:3238:lib/Compilation.js

### `compilation.hooks.beforeChunks`

#### What it's for:
The `beforeChunks` hook in the [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/ChunkTemplate.js#102%2C51-102%2C51) class is used to perform actions right before the chunks are created during the compilation process. This hook allows developers to inspect, analyze, or modify the state of the compilation before the chunk creation phase begins.

#### How it works:
The `beforeChunks` hook is a [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1777%2C22-1777%2C22) that gets called with no arguments. It is part of the Webpack compilation lifecycle and is triggered during the chunk creation phase.

#### How to use it:
To use the `beforeChunks` hook, you need to tap into it using the [tap](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1781%2C15-1781%2C15) method. This allows you to run custom code at the specific point in the compilation process when this hook is called.

#### Example:
Here is an example of how to use the `beforeChunks` hook in a Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyCustomPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.beforeChunks.tap('MyCustomPlugin', () => {
        console.log('beforeChunks hook called');
        // Your custom logic here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyCustomPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in their callbacks:
The `beforeChunks` hook does not accept any parameters or provide any in its callbacks. It is simply called to signal that the chunk creation phase is about to begin.

#### Relevant Code:
The `beforeChunks` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here is the relevant code snippet from the `lib/Compilation.js` file:

```javascript
656:657:lib/Compilation.js
beforeChunks: new SyncHook([]),
```

This hook is part of the `hooks` object in the `Compilation` class, which contains various hooks for different stages of the compilation process.

### `compilation.hooks.afterChunks`

#### What it's for
The `afterChunks` hook is used in the Webpack compilation process. It is called directly after the chunks and module graph have been created and before the chunks and modules have been optimized. This hook is useful for inspecting, analyzing, and/or modifying the chunk graph.

#### How it works
The `afterChunks` hook is a [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1777%2C22-1777%2C22) that takes an iterable of chunks as its argument. It allows you to tap into the compilation process at a specific point to perform custom operations on the chunks.

#### How to use it
To use the `afterChunks` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
class MyCustomPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.thisCompilation.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterChunks.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (chunks) => {
        // Your custom logic here
        console.log('Chunks:', chunks);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyCustomPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts
- `chunks`: An iterable of `Chunk` objects that represent the chunks created during the compilation process.

#### Example
Here is a more detailed example that demonstrates how to use the `afterChunks` hook to log the names of all chunks:

```javascript
class LogChunksPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.thisCompilation.tap('LogChunksPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterChunks.tap('LogChunksPlugin', (chunks) => {
        for (const chunk of chunks) {
          console.log('Chunk name:', chunk.name);
        }
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = LogChunksPlugin;
```

This plugin will log the name of each chunk after the chunks and module graph have been created but before any optimization has taken place.

#### Relevant Code
The `afterChunks` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the codebase:

```javascript
658:664:lib/Compilation.js
/**
 * after the chunks and module graph have been created and before the chunks and modules have been optimized. This hook is useful to
 * inspect, analyze, and/or modify the chunk graph.
 * @type {SyncHook<[Iterable<Chunk>]>}
 */
afterChunks: new SyncHook(["chunks"]),
```

### `compilation.hooks.optimizeDependencies`

#### What it's for
The `optimizeDependencies` hook is a part of the Webpack compilation process within the [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/optimize/ModuleConcatenationPlugin.d.ts#82%2C6-82%2C6) class. This hook is used to optimize dependencies during the build process, allowing developers to apply custom optimization logic to the dependencies of the modules.

#### Details

- **Type**: [SyncBailHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1714%2C25-1714%2C25)
- **Parameters**: [[Iterable<Module>]](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1714%2C47-1714%2C47)
- **Stage**: [STAGE_DEFAULT](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/FlagDependencyUsagePlugin.js#11%2C9-11%2C9)

#### How to Use It

To tap into the `optimizeDependencies` hook, you can use the [tap](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#1487%2C33-1487%2C33) method. This allows you to execute custom logic during the optimization phase. Below is an example of how to use this hook in a custom Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyCustomPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeDependencies.tap(
        { name: 'MyCustomPlugin', stage: STAGE_DEFAULT },
        (modules) => {
          // Custom optimization logic here
          for (const module of modules) {
            // Perform operations on each module
          }
        }
      );
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyCustomPlugin;
```

#### How It Works

The `optimizeDependencies` hook is called during the optimization phase of the Webpack compilation. It allows developers to modify or optimize the dependencies of the modules before the final build output is generated. This hook is particularly useful for making adjustments that improve the efficiency and performance of the module dependencies.

#### What It's For

This hook is useful for performing custom optimizations on the module dependencies. For example, you can use it to:
- Remove unused dependencies
- Merge duplicate dependencies
- Apply custom transformations to the dependencies

#### Example

Here is a simple example of a plugin that logs the number of modules being optimized:

```javascript
class LogModuleCountPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('LogModuleCountPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeDependencies.tap(
        { name: 'LogModuleCountPlugin', stage: STAGE_DEFAULT },
        (modules) => {
          console.log(`Optimizing ${modules.size} modules`);
        }
      );
    });
  }
}

module.exports = LogModuleCountPlugin;
```

#### Parameters

- **modules**: An iterable of `Module` objects that are being optimized.

#### References

- Code block for `optimizeDependencies` hook declaration:

```1713:1713:types.d.ts
		optimizeDependencies: SyncBailHook<[Iterable<Module>], any>;
```

- Code block for `optimizeDependencies` hook usage:

```43:46:lib/FlagDependencyUsagePlugin.js
		compiler.hooks.compilation.tap(PLUGIN_NAME, compilation => {
			const moduleGraph = compilation.moduleGraph;
			compilation.hooks.optimizeDependencies.tap(
				{ name: PLUGIN_NAME, stage: STAGE_DEFAULT },
				(modules) => {
					// Custom optimization logic here
				}
			);
		});
```

### `compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeDependencies`

#### What it is
`compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeDependencies` is a [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1715%2C30-1715%2C30) provided by Webpack's Compilation class. This hook is called after the dependencies of the modules have been optimized.

#### How to Use It
To use the `afterOptimizeDependencies` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeDependencies.tap('MyPlugin', (modules) => {
        // Your custom logic here
        console.log('Dependencies have been optimized');
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### How It Works
- **When it's called**: The `afterOptimizeDependencies` hook is invoked after Webpack has finished optimizing the dependencies of the modules.
- **What it provides**: It provides an iterable of modules that have been optimized.

#### What It's For
This hook is useful for performing custom operations or logging after Webpack has optimized the dependencies of the modules. It allows you to inspect or modify the state of the modules post-optimization.

#### Parameters
The hook provides the following parameters to its callback:
- `modules`: An iterable of the modules whose dependencies have been optimized.

#### Example
Here is a more detailed example demonstrating how to use the `afterOptimizeDependencies` hook to log the number of modules:

```javascript
class LogOptimizedModulesPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('LogOptimizedModulesPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeDependencies.tap('LogOptimizedModulesPlugin', (modules) => {
        const moduleCount = Array.from(modules).length;
        console.log(`Number of optimized modules: ${moduleCount}`);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = LogOptimizedModulesPlugin;
```

#### Relevant Code Snippet
The `afterOptimizeDependencies` hook is declared in the `Compilation` class. Here is the relevant code snippet from the provided codebase:

```typescript
1714:1714:types.d.ts

#### How to Use It
To use the `optimizeModules` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how you can use this hook in a custom Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyCustomPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeModules.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (modules) => {
        // Perform your custom optimization logic here
        for (const module of modules) {
          // Example: Log the module identifier
          console.log(module.identifier());
        }
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyCustomPlugin;
```

#### How It Works
The `optimizeModules` hook is called during the optimization phase of the Webpack compilation process. It receives an iterable of modules as its argument. You can iterate over these modules and perform any necessary optimizations.

#### What It's For
The `optimizeModules` hook is used for optimizing the modules in the compilation. This can include tasks such as:
- Removing unused modules
- Modifying module content
- Adding new modules
- Any other custom optimization logic

#### Parameters
The `optimizeModules` hook accepts the following parameters:
- **modules**: An iterable of modules that are part of the compilation.

#### Example
Here is a more detailed example that demonstrates how to use the `optimizeModules` hook to remove a specific module based on a condition:

```javascript
class RemoveSpecificModulePlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('RemoveSpecificModulePlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeModules.tap('RemoveSpecificModulePlugin', (modules) => {
        for (const module of modules) {
          if (module.identifier().includes('specific-module')) {
            // Remove the module from the compilation
            compilation.modules.delete(module);
          }
        }
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = RemoveSpecificModulePlugin;
```

In this example, the plugin removes any module whose identifier includes the string 'specific-module'.

```javascript
class CustomOptimizationPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('CustomOptimizationPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeTree.tapAsync('CustomOptimizationPlugin', (chunks, modules, callback) => {
        // Custom optimization logic
        for (const chunk of chunks) {
          console.log(`Processing chunk: ${chunk.name}`);
        }
        for (const module of modules) {
          console.log(`Processing module: ${module.identifier()}`);
        }
        // Simulate async operation
        setTimeout(() => {
          console.log('Custom optimization complete.');
          callback();
        }, 500);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = CustomOptimizationPlugin;
```

### `compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeTree`

#### What it is
`compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeTree` is a [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1715%2C30-1715%2C30) provided by Webpack's [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#3095%2C31-3095%2C31) class. It is triggered after the [optimizeTree](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1724%2C3-1724%2C3) hook, which is responsible for optimizing the module and chunk graph.

#### How it works
This hook is called synchronously after the `optimizeTree` hook has completed its asynchronous operations. It allows plugins to perform additional operations or optimizations on the module and chunk graph after the initial tree optimization has been completed.

#### What it's for
The `afterOptimizeTree` hook is used by plugins to perform further optimizations or modifications to the module and chunk graph. This can include tasks such as removing unnecessary modules, merging chunks, or any other optimization that needs to occur after the main tree optimization.

#### How to use it
To use the `afterOptimizeTree` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeTree.tap('MyPlugin', (chunks, modules) => {
        // Your optimization logic here
        console.log('afterOptimizeTree hook called');
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Example
Here is a more detailed example that demonstrates how to use the `afterOptimizeTree` hook to log the chunks and modules:

### `compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkModules`

#### What it is
`compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkModules` is an [AsyncSeriesBailHook](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js#L688) provided by Webpack's [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js#L33) class. This hook is part of the Webpack compilation process and is called during the optimization phase of chunk modules. It allows you to perform asynchronous operations on the chunk modules and potentially bail out of the series if necessary.

#### How it works
The `optimizeChunkModules` hook is called with two parameters: `chunks` and `modules`. These represent the chunks and modules that are being optimized. The hook allows you to perform asynchronous operations on these chunks and modules, and if needed, you can bail out of the series by passing an error to the callback.

#### What it's for
The `optimizeChunkModules` hook is used for optimizing the modules within chunks during the Webpack compilation process. This can include tasks such as code splitting, tree shaking, and other module optimization techniques.

#### How to use it
To use the `optimizeChunkModules` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkModules.tapAsync(
        'MyPlugin',
        (chunks, modules, callback) => {
          // Perform your optimization logic here
          console.log('Optimizing chunk modules...');
          
          // Call the callback when done
          callback();
        }
      );
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Example
Here is an example of using the `optimizeChunkModules` hook to log the chunk and module information:

```javascript
class LogChunkModulesPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('LogChunkModulesPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkModules.tapAsync(
        'LogChunkModulesPlugin',
        (chunks, modules, callback) => {
          chunks.forEach(chunk => {
            console.log(`Chunk: ${chunk.name}`);
          });
          modules.forEach(module => {
            console.log(`Module: ${module.identifier()}`);
          });
          callback();
        }
      );
    });
  }
}

module.exports = LogChunkModulesPlugin;
```

#### Parameters
- `chunks`: An iterable of chunks that are being optimized.
- `modules`: An iterable of modules that are being optimized.
- `callback`: A callback function that must be called when the asynchronous operation is complete.

#### Relevant code
The `optimizeChunkModules` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the `lib/Compilation.js` file:

```javascript
688:689:lib/Compilation.js
			optimizeChunkModules: new AsyncSeriesBailHook(["chunks", "modules"]),
			/** @type {SyncHook<[Iterable<Chunk>, Iterable<Module>]> */
```

This hook is used within the `seal` method of the `Compilation` class, allowing you to perform custom asynchronous operations on the chunks and modules during the optimization phase of the Webpack compilation process.

### `compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeChunkModules`

#### What it is for
The `compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeChunkModules` hook is used in the Webpack compilation process. It is triggered after the chunk modules have been optimized. This hook allows developers to perform additional operations or modifications on the chunks and modules after the optimization phase.

#### How it works
The `compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeChunkModules` hook is a synchronous hook that takes two parameters: `chunks` and `modules`. These parameters represent the chunks and modules that have been optimized. The hook is called after the `compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkModules` hook has completed its operations.

#### How to use it
To use the `compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeChunkModules` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to use this hook in a custom Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyCustomPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeChunkModules.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (chunks, modules) => {
        // Your custom logic here
        console.log('Chunks and modules have been optimized');
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyCustomPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in their callbacks
- `chunks`: An iterable of chunks that have been optimized.
- `modules`: An iterable of modules that have been optimized.

#### Example
Here is a more detailed example of using the `afterOptimizeChunkModules` hook to log the names of the optimized chunks and modules:

```javascript
class LogOptimizedChunksPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('LogOptimizedChunksPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeChunkModules.tap('LogOptimizedChunksPlugin', (chunks, modules) => {
        console.log('Optimized Chunks:');
        for (const chunk of chunks) {
          console.log(chunk.name);
        }

        console.log('Optimized Modules:');
        for (const module of modules) {
          console.log(module.identifier());
        }
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = LogOptimizedChunksPlugin;
```

This plugin logs the names of all optimized chunks and modules after the optimization process is complete.

#### Relevant Code Snippet
The `afterOptimizeChunkModules` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here is the relevant code snippet from the `lib/Compilation.js` file:

```javascript
690:691:lib/Compilation.js
afterOptimizeChunkModules: new SyncHook(["chunks", "modules"]),
```

### `compilation.hooks.shouldRecord`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.shouldRecord` is a [SyncBailHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#56%2C20-56%2C20) in the Webpack compilation process. It determines whether the current compilation should record module and chunk information.

#### How it works:
- This hook is called during the compilation process to decide if recording should occur.
- If any of the registered functions return `true`, the recording process will proceed.
- If all registered functions return `undefined`, the recording process will not proceed.

#### Parameters:
- This hook does not accept any parameters.

#### Usage:
To use this hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to use it:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.shouldRecord.tap('MyPlugin', () => {
        // Your logic to determine if recording should occur
        const shouldRecord = /* some condition */;
        return shouldRecord;
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Example:
Here is a simple example of a plugin that uses the `shouldRecord` hook to always enable recording:

```javascript
class AlwaysRecordPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('AlwaysRecordPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.shouldRecord.tap('AlwaysRecordPlugin', () => {
        return true; // Always record
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = AlwaysRecordPlugin;
```

#### What it's for:
This hook is useful for plugins that need to conditionally enable or disable the recording of module and chunk information based on custom logic. This can be particularly useful for performance optimizations or conditional logging.

#### References:
- Code defining the hook:

```typescript
71:72:types/Compilation.d.ts
        /** @type {SyncBailHook<[], boolean | undefined>} */
        shouldRecord: SyncBailHook<[], boolean | undefined>
```

- Example usage in the Webpack codebase:

```javascript
67:91:lib/RecordIdsPlugin.js
		compiler.hooks.compilation.tap(PLUGIN_NAME, compilation => {
			compilation.hooks.shouldRecord.tap(PLUGIN_NAME, () => {
				return true;
			});
		});
```

### `compilation.hooks.additionalChunkRuntimeRequirements`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.additionalChunkRuntimeRequirements` is a [SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L74) provided by Webpack's [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js#L690) class. This hook allows you to add additional runtime requirements to a chunk during the compilation process.

#### How to use it:
You can tap into this hook to add custom runtime requirements for chunks. This is useful when you need to ensure that certain runtime features or modules are included in the final output for specific chunks.

#### How it works:
The hook is called with three parameters:
1. **chunk**: The chunk for which runtime requirements are being processed.
2. **runtimeRequirements**: A `Set` of runtime requirements that can be modified.
3. **context**: An object containing the `chunkGraph` and `codeGenerationResults`.

You can add your custom runtime requirements to the `runtimeRequirements` set within the hook.

#### Example:
Here is an example of how to use the `additionalChunkRuntimeRequirements` hook to add a custom runtime requirement:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.additionalChunkRuntimeRequirements.tap(
        'MyPlugin',
        (chunk, runtimeRequirements, context) => {
          // Add a custom runtime requirement
          runtimeRequirements.add('myCustomRuntimeRequirement');
        }
      );
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in their callbacks:
- **chunk**: The chunk for which runtime requirements are being processed.
- **runtimeRequirements**: A `Set` of runtime requirements that can be modified.
- **context**: An object containing:
    - `chunkGraph`: The chunk graph.
    - `codeGenerationResults`: The results of code generation.

#### Relevant Code:

- Hook definition:

```typescript
73:74:types/Compilation.d.ts
/** @type {SyncHook<[Chunk, Set<string>, RuntimeRequirementsContext]>} */
additionalChunkRuntimeRequirements: SyncHook<[Chunk, Set<string>, RuntimeRequirementsContext]>;
```

- Hook usage:

```javascript
695:700:lib/Compilation.js
additionalChunkRuntimeRequirements: new SyncHook([
  "chunk",
  "runtimeRequirements",
  "context"
]),
```

- Hook call in the compilation process:

```javascript
3608:3624:lib/Compilation.js
this.logger.time("runtime requirements.chunks");
for (const chunk of chunks) {
  const set = new Set();
  for (const module of chunkGraph.getChunkModulesIterable(chunk)) {
    const runtimeRequirements = chunkGraph.getModuleRuntimeRequirements(
      module,
      chunk.runtime
    );
    for (const r of runtimeRequirements) set.add(r);
  }

```

This hook is particularly useful for extending Webpack's runtime behavior for specific chunks, ensuring that all necessary runtime features are included.

### `compilation.hooks.runtimeRequirementInChunk`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.runtimeRequirementInChunk` is a [HookMap](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L76) of [SyncBailHook](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L76) hooks in the Webpack [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js#L701) class. This hook is used to handle runtime requirements for chunks during the compilation process in Webpack.

#### How it works:
The `runtimeRequirementInChunk` hook is invoked during the [processRuntimeRequirements](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js#L3526) method of the [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js#L701) class. It iterates over the chunks and their modules, collects runtime requirements, and then calls the appropriate hooks for each runtime requirement.

#### How to use it:
To use `runtimeRequirementInChunk`, you need to tap into the hook for a specific runtime requirement. This allows you to add custom behavior or modify the existing behavior for that runtime requirement in chunks.

#### Parameters:
- **chunk**: The chunk for which the runtime requirement is being processed.
- **runtimeRequirements**: A set of runtime requirements for the chunk.
- **context**: An object containing:
    - **chunkGraph**: The chunk graph.
    - **codeGenerationResults**: The results of code generation.

#### What it's for:
The `runtimeRequirementInChunk` hook is used to manage and customize the runtime requirements for chunks. This is particularly useful for adding or modifying the behavior of runtime features like chunk loading, HMR (Hot Module Replacement), and other runtime-related functionalities.

#### Example:
Here is an example of how to tap into the `runtimeRequirementInChunk` hook:

```javascript
compilation.hooks.runtimeRequirementInChunk.for(RuntimeGlobals.ensureChunk).tap(
  "MyPlugin",
  (chunk, runtimeRequirements, context) => {
    // Custom behavior for the ensureChunk runtime requirement
    console.log(`Processing runtime requirement for chunk: ${chunk.id}`);
  }
);
```

#### Relevant Code:
The `runtimeRequirementInChunk` hook is defined and used in the following lines:

- Hook definition:

```typescript
75:76:types/Compilation.d.ts
/** @type {HookMap<SyncBailHook<[Chunk, Set<string>, RuntimeRequirementsContext], void>>} */
runtimeRequirementInChunk: HookMap<SyncBailHook<[Chunk, Set<string>, RuntimeRequirementsContext], void>>;
```

- Hook instantiation:

```javascript
701:704:lib/Compilation.js
runtimeRequirementInChunk: new HookMap(
  () => new SyncBailHook(["chunk", "runtimeRequirements", "context"])
),
```

- Hook call in the compilation process:

```javascript
3620:3622:lib/Compilation.js
for (const r of set) {
  this.hooks.runtimeRequirementInChunk.for(r).call(chunk, set, context);
}
```

This hook is particularly useful for extending Webpack's runtime behavior for specific chunks, ensuring that all necessary runtime features are included.

### `compilation.hooks.additionalModuleRuntimeRequirements`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.additionalModuleRuntimeRequirements` is a [SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L74) provided by Webpack's [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js#L705) class. This hook allows you to add additional runtime requirements to a module during the compilation process.

#### How it works:
The `additionalModuleRuntimeRequirements` hook is invoked during the [processRuntimeRequirements](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js#L3526) method of the [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js#L705) class. It allows plugins to add or modify the runtime requirements of a module. The runtime requirements are essential for determining what runtime code needs to be included for a module to function correctly.

#### How to use it:
To use the `additionalModuleRuntimeRequirements` hook, you need to tap into it using one of the tap methods ([tap](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/ModuleTemplate.js#L36), [tapAsync](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L143), or [tapPromise](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L143)). This hook is called with three parameters: the module, a set of runtime requirements, and the context.

#### What it's for:
This hook is primarily used by plugins that need to ensure specific runtime requirements are added to modules. For example, a plugin might need to ensure that certain global variables or functions are available at runtime for a module to execute correctly.

#### Example:
Here is an example of how you might tap into the `additionalModuleRuntimeRequirements` hook:

```javascript
compilation.hooks.additionalModuleRuntimeRequirements.tap(
  "MyPlugin",
  (module, runtimeRequirements, context) => {
    // Add a custom runtime requirement
    runtimeRequirements.add(RuntimeGlobals.require);
  }
);
```

#### Parameters:
- **module**: The module for which the runtime requirements are being processed.
- **runtimeRequirements**: A set of runtime requirements that can be modified.
- **context**: An object containing the chunkGraph and codeGenerationResults.

#### Relevant Code:

This hook is particularly useful when modules need to be restored from a cache or when certain operations need to be performed on modules that are being revived.

#### How to use it:
To use the [reviveModules](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#89%2C9-89%2C9) hook, you need to tap into it using the [tap](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/ids/SyncModuleIdsPlugin.js#76%2C34-76%2C34) method provided by the [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#88%2C20-88%2C20) class. This allows you to add custom behavior that will be executed when the hook is called.

#### How it works:
The [reviveModules](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#89%2C9-89%2C9) hook is called with two arguments:
1. [modules](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#45%2C51-45%2C51): An iterable of modules that are being revived.
2. [records](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#729%2C45-729%2C45): Additional data or records associated with the modules.

#### What it's for:
The [reviveModules](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#89%2C9-89%2C9) hook is used to perform operations on modules that are being revived during the compilation process. This can include restoring module IDs, updating module states, or any other custom logic that needs to be applied to the revived modules.

#### Example:
Here is an example of how to tap into the [reviveModules](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#89%2C9-89%2C9) hook:

```javascript
compilation.hooks.reviveModules.tap('MyPlugin', (modules, records) => {
  for (const module of modules) {
    // Custom logic for each revived module
    console.log(`Reviving module: ${module.identifier()}`);
  }
});
```

#### Parameters:
- `modules`: An iterable of modules that are being revived.
- `records`: Additional data or records associated with the modules.

#### Relevant Code:
The `reviveModules` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class and can be found in the following code block:

```javascript
// ... (other code)

/**
 * @typedef {SyncHook<Iterable<Module>, { records: Record<string, any> }> ReviveModulesHook
 */

/**
 * @type {ReviveModulesHook}
 */
compilation.hooks.reviveModules = new SyncHook();

// ... (other code)
```

### `compilation.hooks.beforeModuleIds`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.beforeModuleIds` is a [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#88%2C20-88%2C20) provided by the Webpack [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/ids/IdHelpers.js#421%2C12-421%2C12) class. This hook is triggered before the module IDs are assigned during the compilation process.

#### How to use it:
To use this hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. This allows you to execute custom logic right before Webpack assigns IDs to the modules.

#### How it works:
When the [beforeModuleIds](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#91%2C9-91%2C9) hook is called, it provides an iterable of modules that are about to have their IDs assigned. You can perform operations or modifications on these modules before the ID assignment process begins.

#### What it's for:
This hook is useful for plugins that need to perform actions or transformations on modules before their IDs are set. For example, you might want to sort or filter the modules, or perform some custom logging or analysis.

#### Example:
Here is an example of how to use the [beforeModuleIds](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#91%2C9-91%2C9) hook in a custom Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyCustomPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.beforeModuleIds.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (modules) => {
        // Custom logic to be executed before module IDs are assigned

It is used to tap into the process of reviving chunks during the compilation phase.

#### How to use it:
To use this hook, you need to tap into it using one of the available tap methods ([tap](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/ChunkTemplate.js#60%2C5-60%2C5), [tapAsync](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1781%2C23-1781%2C23), or [tapPromise](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1781%2C36-1781%2C36)). This allows you to execute custom logic when the hook is called.

#### How it works:
The [reviveChunks](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#99%2C9-99%2C9) hook is called with two arguments:
1. [chunks](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/examples/named-chunks/README.md#213%2C21-213%2C21): An iterable of [Chunk](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#98%2C39-98%2C39) instances that are being revived.
2. [records](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#729%2C45-729%2C45): An object containing records related to the chunks.

#### What it's for:
This hook is useful for plugins or custom logic that need to perform operations when chunks are being revived from records. This can be part of a caching mechanism or any other process that involves restoring chunk state.

#### Example:
Here is an example of how to tap into the [reviveChunks](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#99%2C9-99%2C9) hook:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.reviveChunks.tap('MyPlugin', (chunks, records) => {
        // Custom logic to execute when chunks are revived
        console.log('Chunks are being revived:', chunks);
        console.log('Records:', records);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in their callbacks:
- `chunks`: An iterable of `Chunk` instances.
- `records`: An object containing records related to the chunks.

#### Relevant Code:

```98:99:types/Compilation.d.ts
        reviveChunks: SyncHook<[Iterable<Chunk>, any]>;
        /** @type {SyncHook<[Iterable<Chunk>]>} */
```


```740:741:lib/Compilation.js
			reviveChunks: new SyncHook(["chunks", "records"]),
			/** @type {SyncHook<[Iterable<Chunk>]>} */
```


### `compilation.hooks.beforeChunkIds`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.beforeChunkIds` is a [SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#synchook) provided by the Webpack [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js) class. It is triggered before chunk IDs are assigned to the chunks in the compilation process.

#### How to use it:
To use this hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. This allows you to execute custom logic right before Webpack assigns IDs to chunks.

#### How it works:
When the Webpack compilation reaches the stage where it is about to assign IDs to chunks, it triggers the `beforeChunkIds` hook. Any registered plugins that have tapped into this hook will have their callback functions executed at this point.

#### What it's for:
This hook is useful for performing operations or modifications on chunks before their IDs are assigned. This can be particularly useful for custom chunk ID strategies or for logging and debugging purposes.

#### Example:
Here is an example of how to tap into the `beforeChunkIds` hook within a custom Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyCustomPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.beforeChunkIds.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (chunks) => {
        console.log('Before chunk IDs are assigned:', chunks);
        // Perform custom operations on chunks here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyCustomPlugin;
```

#### Parameters:
- `chunks`: An iterable of chunks that are about to have their IDs assigned.

#### Relevant Code:
The `beforeChunkIds` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here is the relevant part of the code:

```javascript
const { SyncHook } = require("tapable");

class Compilation {
  constructor(compiler) {
    // Other initializations...
    this.hooks = {
      // Other hooks...
      beforeChunkIds: new SyncHook(["chunks"]),
      // Other hooks...
    };
    // Other code...
  }
  // Other methods...
}

module.exports = Compilation;
```

This shows the definition of the `beforeChunkIds` hook as a `SyncHook` that takes an iterable of chunks.


### `compilation.hooks.chunkIds`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.chunkIds` is a [SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#synchook) provided by the Webpack [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js) class. This hook is used to tap into the process of assigning IDs to chunks during the compilation phase. This allows plugins to modify or assign chunk IDs based on custom logic.

#### How to use it:
To use the `chunkIds` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
class MyChunkIdPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyChunkIdPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.chunkIds.tap('MyChunkIdPlugin', (chunks) => {
        // Custom logic to assign chunk IDs
        chunks.forEach((chunk, index) => {
          chunk.id = `custom-id-${index}`;
        });
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyChunkIdPlugin;
```

#### How it works:
1. **Tapping into the Compilation Hook**: The plugin first taps into the `compilation` hook of the `compiler` to gain access to the `compilation` object.
2. **Tapping into the `chunkIds` Hook**: Within the `compilation` hook, the plugin then taps into the `chunkIds` hook.
3. **Custom Logic**: The plugin can then execute custom logic to assign or modify chunk IDs. In the example above, each chunk is assigned a custom ID based on its index.

#### What it's for:
The `chunkIds` hook is primarily used for customizing the way chunk IDs are assigned. This can be useful for:
- Ensuring consistent chunk IDs across builds for better caching.
- Implementing custom chunk ID schemes.
- Integrating with other tools or systems that require specific chunk ID formats.

#### Examples

**Example 1: Assigning Natural Chunk IDs**
This example shows how the `NaturalChunkIdsPlugin` uses the `chunkIds` hook to assign natural chunk IDs.

```javascript
// lib/ids/NaturalChunkIdsPlugin.js
class NaturalChunkIdsPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('NaturalChunkIdsPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.chunkIds.tap('NaturalChunkIdsPlugin', (chunks) => {
        const chunkGraph = compilation.chunkGraph;
        const compareNatural = compareChunksNatural(chunkGraph);
        const chunksInNaturalOrder = Array.from(chunks).sort(compareNatural);
        assignAscendingChunkIds(chunksInNaturalOrder, compilation);
      });
    });
  }
}
```

**Example 2: Assigning Deterministic Chunk IDs**
This example demonstrates how the `DeterministicChunkIdsPlugin` assigns deterministic chunk IDs using the `chunkIds` hook.

```javascript
// lib/ids/DeterministicChunkIdsPlugin.js
class DeterministicChunkIdsPlugin {
  constructor(options = {}) {
    this.options = options;
  }

  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('DeterministicChunkIdsPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.chunkIds.tap('DeterministicChunkIdsPlugin', (chunks) => {
        const chunkGraph = compilation.chunkGraph;
        const context = this.options.context || compiler.context;
        const maxLength = this.options.maxLength || 3;
        const deterministicIds = getDeterministicChunkIds(compilation, context, maxLength);
        chunks.forEach((chunk) => {
          chunk.id = deterministicIds.get(chunk);
        });
      });
    });
  }
}
```

#### Parameters the Hook Accepts or Provides in Callbacks:
- **chunks**: An iterable of `Chunk` objects that are part of the compilation. The callback function can iterate over these chunks to assign or modify their IDs.

#### Relevant Code:
The `chunkIds` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the codebase:

```javascript
// lib/Compilation.js
const { SyncHook } = require('tapable');

class Compilation {
  constructor(compiler) {
    // Other initializations...
    this.hooks = {
      // Other hooks...
      chunkIds: new SyncHook(['chunks']),
      // Other hooks...
    };
    // Other code...
  }
  // Other methods...
}

module.exports = Compilation;
```

This shows the definition of the `chunkIds` hook as a `SyncHook` that takes an iterable of chunks. By using this hook, developers can have fine-grained control over the chunk ID assignment process, enabling more advanced and customized build configurations.

### `compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkIds`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkIds` is a [SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#synchook) provided by the Webpack [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js) class. This hook is used during the chunk optimization phase to allow plugins to optimize chunk IDs.

#### How to use it:
To use the `optimizeChunkIds` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
class MyChunkIdOptimizerPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyChunkIdOptimizerPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkIds.tap('MyChunkIdOptimizerPlugin', (chunks) => {
        // Your optimization logic here
        console.log('Optimizing chunk IDs');
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyChunkIdOptimizerPlugin;
```

#### How it works:
The `optimizeChunkIds` hook is called during the chunk optimization phase. Plugins can tap into this hook to perform custom optimizations on chunk IDs. This is particularly useful for ensuring that chunk IDs are assigned in a way that benefits caching or other performance metrics.

#### What it's for:
The `optimizeChunkIds` hook is used to optimize the assignment of chunk IDs. This can help in scenarios where you want to ensure that chunk IDs are assigned deterministically or in a way that minimizes the size of the generated bundles.

#### Example:
Here is an example of a plugin that uses the `optimizeChunkIds` hook to log a message during the chunk ID optimization phase:

```javascript
class LogChunkIdsPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('LogChunkIdsPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkIds.tap('LogChunkIdsPlugin', (chunks) => {
        console.log('Chunks before optimization:', chunks);
        // Perform optimization here
        console.log('Chunks after optimization:', chunks);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = LogChunkIdsPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the Hook Accepts:
The `optimizeChunkIds` hook accepts a single parameter:
- `chunks`: An iterable of `Chunk` objects that are to be optimized.

#### Relevant Code:
The `optimizeChunkIds` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the `lib/Compilation.js` file:

  constructor(compiler) {
    // Other initializations...
    this.hooks = {
      // Other hooks...
      optimizeChunkIds: new SyncHook(["chunks"]),
      // Other hooks...
    };
    // Other code...
  }
  // Other methods...
}

module.exports = Compilation;
```

This hook is tapped into by various plugins to perform chunk ID optimizations. For example, the `OccurrenceChunkIdsPlugin` uses this hook to assign chunk IDs based on their occurrence:

```javascript
// lib/ids/OccurrenceChunkIdsPlugin.js
const compareChunksNatural = require('./compareChunksNatural');
const assignAscendingChunkIds = require('./assignAscendingChunkIds');

class OccurrenceChunkIdsPlugin {
  constructor(options = {}) {
    this.options = options;
  }

  apply(compiler) {
    const { prioritiseInitial } = this.options;
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap("OccurrenceChunkIdsPlugin", (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkIds.tap("OccurrenceChunkIdsPlugin", (chunks) => {
        const chunkGraph = compilation.chunkGraph;

        const occursInInitialChunksMap = new Map();

        for (const c of chunks) {
          let occurs = 0;
          for (const chunkGroup of c.groupsIterable) {
            for (const parent of chunkGroup.parentsIterable) {
              if (parent.isInitial()) occurs++;
            }
          }
          occursInInitialChunksMap.set(c, occurs);
        }

        const chunksInOccurrenceOrder = Array.from(chunks).sort((a, b) => {
          if (prioritiseInitial) {
            const aEntryOccurs = occursInInitialChunksMap.get(a);
            const bEntryOccurs = occursInInitialChunksMap.get(b);
            if (aEntryOccurs > bEntryOccurs) return -1;
            if (aEntryOccurs < bEntryOccurs) return 1;
          }
          const aOccurs = a.getNumberOfGroups();
          const bOccurs = b.getNumberOfGroups();
          if (aOccurs > bOccurs) return -1;
          if (aOccurs < bOccurs) return 1;
          return compareChunksNatural(a, b);
        });
        assignAscendingChunkIds(chunksInOccurrenceOrder, compilation);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = OccurrenceChunkIdsPlugin;
```

By using the `optimizeChunkIds` hook, developers can have fine-grained control over the chunk ID optimization process, enabling more advanced and customized build configurations.

#### What It's For

The `afterOptimizeChunkIds` hook is used to perform operations that depend on the final chunk IDs. This can include logging, further optimizations, or any other tasks that should occur after chunk IDs have been optimized.

#### Example

Here is an example of a plugin that uses the `afterOptimizeChunkIds` hook to log a message after the chunk ID optimization phase:

```javascript
class LogAfterOptimizeChunkIdsPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('LogAfterOptimizeChunkIdsPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeChunkIds.tap('LogAfterOptimizeChunkIdsPlugin', (chunks) => {
        console.log('Chunks after optimization:', chunks);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = LogAfterOptimizeChunkIdsPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the Hook Accepts

The `afterOptimizeChunkIds` hook accepts a single parameter:

- `chunks`: An iterable of `Chunk` objects that have been optimized.

#### Relevant Code

The `afterOptimizeChunkIds` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the `lib/Compilation.js` file:

```javascript
// lib/Compilation.js
const { SyncHook } = require('tapable');

class Compilation {
  constructor(compiler) {
    // Other initializations...
    this.hooks = {
      // Other hooks...
      optimizeChunkIds: new SyncHook(["chunks"]),
      afterOptimizeChunkIds: new SyncHook(["chunks"]),
      // Other hooks...
    };
    // Other code...
  }
  // Other methods...
}

module.exports = Compilation;
```

This hook is tapped into by various plugins to perform operations after chunk ID optimizations. For example, the `OccurrenceChunkIdsPlugin` uses this hook to log the final chunk IDs:

```javascript
// lib/ids/OccurrenceChunkIdsPlugin.js
const compareChunksNatural = require('./compareChunksNatural');
const assignAscendingChunkIds = require('./assignAscendingChunkIds');

class OccurrenceChunkIdsPlugin {
  constructor(options = {}) {
    this.options = options;
  }

  apply(compiler) {
    const { prioritiseInitial } = this.options;
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap("OccurrenceChunkIdsPlugin", (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkIds.tap("OccurrenceChunkIdsPlugin", (chunks) => {
        const chunkGraph = compilation.chunkGraph;

        const occursInInitialChunksMap = new Map();

        for (const c of chunks) {
          let occurs = 0;
          for (const chunkGroup of c.groupsIterable) {
            for (const parent of chunkGroup.parentsIterable) {
              if (parent.isInitial()) occurs++;
            }
          }
          occursInInitialChunksMap.set(c, occurs);
        }

        const chunksInOccurrenceOrder = Array.from(chunks).sort((a, b) => {
          if (prioritiseInitial) {
            const aEntryOccurs = occursInInitialChunksMap.get(a);
            const bEntryOccurs = occursInInitialChunksMap.get(b);
            if (aEntryOccurs > bEntryOccurs) return -1;
            if (aEntryOccurs < bEntryOccurs) return 1;
          }
          const aOccurs = a.getNumberOfGroups();
          const bOccurs = b.getNumberOfGroups();
          if (aOccurs > bOccurs) return -1;
          if (aOccurs < bOccurs) return 1;
          return compareChunksNatural(a, b);
        });
        assignAscendingChunkIds(chunksInOccurrenceOrder, compilation);
      });

      compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeChunkIds.tap("OccurrenceChunkIdsPlugin", (chunks) => {
        console.log("Optimized chunk IDs:", chunks);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = OccurrenceChunkIdsPlugin;
```

By using the `afterOptimizeChunkIds` hook, developers can ensure that their custom logic is executed after chunk IDs have been optimized, allowing for further customization and control over the build process.

### `compilation.hooks.recordModules`

#### What it's for
The `recordModules` hook in the [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/NormalModule.js#231%2C20-231%2C20) class is used to record information about modules during the compilation process. This is typically used for caching or tracking purposes, ensuring that module states can be restored or analyzed later.

#### How it works
The `recordModules` hook is a [SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#synchook) that takes two parameters:
1. `modules`: An iterable of modules that are being recorded.
2. `records`: An object where the recorded information will be stored.

This hook is called during the compilation process to capture the state of modules, which can then be used for various purposes such as caching, debugging, or incremental builds.

#### How to use it
To use the `recordModules` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.recordModules.tap('MyPlugin', (modules, records) => {
        // Your custom logic to handle the modules and records
        for (const module of modules) {
          // Example: Record module identifier
          if (!records.modules) records.modules = {};
          records.modules[module.identifier()] = module.id;
        }
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in their callbacks
- **modules**: An iterable of `Module` instances that are being recorded.
- **records**: An object where the recorded information will be stored. This object can be modified to include custom data about the modules.

#### Example
Here is a more detailed example of using the `recordModules` hook within a Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class RecordModulesPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('RecordModulesPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.recordModules.tap('RecordModulesPlugin', (modules, records) => {
        if (!records.modules) records.modules = {};
        for (const module of modules) {
          // Record the module's identifier and id
          records.modules[module.identifier()] = module.id;
        }
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = RecordModulesPlugin;
```

This plugin will record the identifier and id of each module during the compilation process and store it in the `records` object.

#### Relevant Code Reference

```javascript
// types/Compilation.d.ts
/** @type {SyncHook<[Iterable<Module>, any]>} */
recordModules: SyncHook<[Iterable<Module>, any]>;
```

```javascript
// lib/RecordIdsPlugin.js
compilation.hooks.recordChunks.tap(
  "RecordIdsPlugin",
  /**
   * @param {Iterable<Chunk>} chunks the chunks array
   * @param {Records} records the records object
   * @returns {void}
   */
  (chunks, records) => {
    if (!records.chunks) records.chunks = {};
    if (!records.chunks.byName) records.chunks.byName = {};
    if (!records.chunks.bySource) records.chunks.bySource = {};
    /** @type {Set<number>} */
    const usedIds = new Set();
    for (const chunk of chunks) {
      if (typeof chunk.id !== "number") continue;
      const name = chunk.name;
      if (name) records.chunks.byName[name] = chunk.id;
      const sources = getChunkSources(chunk);
      for (const source of sources) {
        records.chunks.bySource[source] = chunk.id;
      }
      usedIds.add(chunk.id);
    }
    records.chunks.usedIds = Array.from(usedIds).sort(compareNumbers);
  }
);
```

This hook is part of the `Compilation` class's `hooks` object, which contains various hooks for different stages of the compilation process.


### `compilation.hooks.recordChunks`

#### What it's for
The `recordChunks` hook in the Webpack `Compilation` class is used to record information about chunks during the compilation process. This is particularly useful for maintaining chunk IDs across builds, which helps in long-term caching by ensuring that chunk IDs remain consistent.

#### How it works
The `recordChunks` hook is a part of the `Compilation` class in Webpack. It is triggered during the compilation process to record the state of chunks. This hook allows plugins to tap into the chunk recording process and store relevant information about chunks in a `records` object.

#### How to use it
To use the `recordChunks` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.recordChunks.tap('MyPlugin', (chunks, records) => {
        // Your logic to record chunk information
        for (const chunk of chunks) {
          // Example: Record chunk ID by name
          if (!records.chunks) records.chunks = {};
          if (!records.chunks.byName) records.chunks.byName = {};
          if (chunk.name) {
            records.chunks.byName[chunk.name] = chunk.id;
          }
        }
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in its callbacks
- **chunks**: An iterable of `Chunk` objects representing the chunks in the compilation.
- **records**: An object where the recorded information about chunks will be stored.

#### Example
Here is an example of a plugin that uses the `recordChunks` hook to record chunk IDs by their names:

```javascript
class RecordChunkIdsPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('RecordChunkIdsPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.recordChunks.tap('RecordChunkIdsPlugin', (chunks, records) => {
        if (!records.chunks) records.chunks = {};
        if (!records.chunks.byName) records.chunks.byName = {};
        for (const chunk of chunks) {
          if (chunk.name) {
            records.chunks.byName[chunk.name] = chunk.id;
          }
        }
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = RecordChunkIdsPlugin;
```

This plugin will ensure that chunk IDs are recorded by their names in the `records` object, which can be useful for maintaining consistent chunk IDs across builds.

#### Relevant Code
The `recordChunks` hook is defined and used in the following lines of the codebase:

```javascript
// lib/RecordIdsPlugin.js
compilation.hooks.recordChunks.tap(
  "RecordIdsPlugin",
  /**
   * @param {Iterable<Chunk>} chunks the chunks array
   * @param {Records} records the records object
   * @returns {void}
   */
  (chunks, records) => {
    if (!records.chunks) records.chunks = {};
    if (!records.chunks.byName) records.chunks.byName = {};
    if (!records.chunks.bySource) records.chunks.bySource = {};
    /** @type {Set<number>} */
    const usedIds = new Set();
    for (const chunk of chunks) {
      if (typeof chunk.id !== "number") continue;
      const name = chunk.name;
      if (name) records.chunks.byName[name] = chunk.id;
      const sources = getChunkSources(chunk);
      for (const source of sources) {
        records.chunks.bySource[source] = chunk.id;
      }
      usedIds.add(chunk.id);
    }
    records.chunks.usedIds = Array.from(usedIds).sort(compareNumbers);
  }
);
```

This code snippet shows how the `recordChunks` hook is used to record chunk information such as chunk IDs and sources, storing them in the `records` object for future reference.

### `compilation.hooks.optimizeCodeGeneration`

#### What it's for
The `optimizeCodeGeneration` hook in the Webpack `Compilation` class is used to optimize the code generation process during the compilation phase. This hook allows plugins to tap into the code generation process and apply custom optimizations to the generated code.

#### How it works
The `optimizeCodeGeneration` hook is a `SyncHook` that takes an iterable of `Module` objects. It is called during the code generation phase of the compilation process, allowing plugins to modify or optimize the code that is generated for each module.

#### How to use it
To use the `optimizeCodeGeneration` hook, you need to tap into it from within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
class MyOptimizationPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyOptimizationPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeCodeGeneration.tap('MyOptimizationPlugin', (modules) => {
        for (const module of modules) {
          // Apply custom optimization logic to the module
          console.log(`Optimizing code generation for module: ${module.identifier()}`);
        }
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyOptimizationPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in their callbacks
- **modules**: An iterable of `Module` objects that are being processed during the code generation phase.

#### Example
Here is a more detailed example of a plugin that uses the `optimizeCodeGeneration` hook to log the identifiers of all modules being processed:

```javascript
class LogModuleIdentifiersPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('LogModuleIdentifiersPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeCodeGeneration.tap('LogModuleIdentifiersPlugin', (modules) => {
        for (const module of modules) {
          console.log(`Module identifier: ${module.identifier()}`);
        }
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = LogModuleIdentifiersPlugin;
```

This plugin will log the identifier of each module during the code generation phase, allowing you to see which modules are being processed.

#### Relevant Code
The `optimizeCodeGeneration` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the codebase:

```typescript
// types/Compilation.d.ts
// ...
/** @type {SyncHook<[Iterable<Module>]>} */
optimizeCodeGeneration: SyncHook<[Iterable<Module>]>;
// ...
```

```javascript
// lib/Compilation.js
class Compilation {
  constructor(compiler, params) {
    // ...
    this.hooks = {
      // ...
      optimizeCodeGeneration: new SyncHook(['modules']),
      // ...
    };
  }
  // ...
}
```

These snippets show how the `optimizeCodeGeneration` hook is defined and initialized within the `Compilation` class. This hook is part of the larger Webpack compilation process, allowing developers to customize and optimize code generation for modules.

### `compilation.hooks.beforeModuleHash`

The `compilation.hooks.beforeModuleHash` is a [SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L116) provided by the Webpack [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/NormalModule.js#L1036) class. This hook is called before the module hashes are created during the compilation process.

### How to Use It

To use the `beforeModuleHash` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.beforeModuleHash.tap('MyPlugin', () => {
        console.log('Before module hash creation');
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

### How It Works

The `beforeModuleHash` hook is a synchronous hook that allows you to run custom code right before Webpack starts creating hashes for the modules. This can be useful for tasks such as logging, modifying the state, or performing any preparatory steps needed before the hashing process.

### What It's For

This hook is primarily used for custom plugins that need to perform actions before the module hashing process begins. It provides a point in the compilation lifecycle where you can intervene and execute your code.

### Example

Here is a more detailed example of using the `beforeModuleHash` hook in a custom Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class CustomHashPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('CustomHashPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.beforeModuleHash.tap('CustomHashPlugin', () => {
        console.log('Custom logic before module hash creation');
        // Add your custom logic here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = CustomHashPlugin;
```

### Parameters the Hook Accepts or Provides in Their Callbacks

The `beforeModuleHash` hook does not accept any parameters in its callback. It is simply a point in the compilation process where you can execute your code.

### Relevant Code Snippet

The `beforeModuleHash` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here is the relevant code snippet from the `Compilation` class:

```typescript
// types/Compilation.d.ts
/** @type {SyncHook<[]>} */
beforeModuleHash: SyncHook<[]>;
```

```javascript
// lib/Compilation.js
class Compilation {
  constructor() {
    this.hooks = {
      // ...
      beforeModuleHash: new SyncHook([]),
      // ...
    };
  }
  // ...
}
```

These snippets show the definition and initialization of the `beforeModuleHash` hook within the `Compilation` class. This hook is part of the larger Webpack compilation process, allowing developers to insert custom logic at specific points in the build lifecycle.

### `compilation.hooks.afterModuleHash`

#### What it's for
The [afterModuleHash](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L117) hook in the Webpack [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L134) class is a synchronous hook that is called after the module hashes have been created. This hook allows you to perform additional operations or modifications after the module hashes are generated.

#### How it works
The [afterModuleHash](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L117) hook is a [SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#synchook) from the [tapable](https://github.com/webpack/tapable) library, which means it runs synchronously and does not expect any return value. It is triggered after the [createModuleHashes](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js#L4033) method completes the hashing process for all modules.

#### How to use it
To use the [afterModuleHash](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L117) hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterModuleHash.tap('MyPlugin', () => {
        console.log('Module hashes have been created.');
        // Perform additional operations here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Example
In the example above, the `MyPlugin` class taps into the `compilation.hooks.afterModuleHash` hook. When the hook is called, it logs a message to the console. You can replace the `console.log` statement with any other logic you need to execute after the module hashes are created.

#### Parameters
The `afterModuleHash` hook does not accept any parameters. It is simply a signal that the module hashing process has completed.

#### Relevant Code
The `afterModuleHash` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here is the relevant part of the code:

```typescript
// types/Compilation.d.ts
/** @type {SyncHook<[]>} */
afterModuleHash: SyncHook<[]>;
```

And it is called in the `createModuleHashes` method:

```javascript
// lib/Compilation.js
class Compilation {
  // ...

  createModuleHashes() {
    let statModulesHashed = 0;
    let statModulesFromCache = 0;
    const { chunkGraph, runtimeTemplate, moduleMemCaches2 } = this;
    const { hashFunction, hashDigest, hashDigestLength } = this.outputOptions;
    /** @type {WebpackError[]} */
    const errors = [];
    for (const module of this.modules) {
      const memCache = moduleMemCaches2 && moduleMemCaches2.get(module);
      for (const runtime of chunkGraph.getModuleRuntimes(module)) {
        if (memCache) {
          const digest = memCache.get(`moduleHash-${getRuntimeKey(runtime)}`);
          if (digest !== undefined) {
            chunkGraph.setModuleHashes(
              module,
              runtime,
              digest,
              digest.slice(0, hashDigestLength)
            );
            statModulesFromCache++;
            continue;
          }
        }
        statModulesHashed++;
        const digest = this._createModuleHash(
          module,
          chunkGraph,
          runtime,
          hashFunction,
          runtimeTemplate,
          hashDigest,
          hashDigestLength,
          errors
        );
        if (memCache) {
          memCache.set(`moduleHash-${getRuntimeKey(runtime)}`, digest);
        }
      }
    }
    if (errors.length > 0) {
      errors.sort(compareSelect(err => err.module, compareModulesByIdentifier));
      for (const error of errors) {
        this.errors.push(error);
      }
    }
    this.logger.log(
      `${statModulesHashed} modules hashed, ${statModulesFromCache} from cache (${
        Math.round(
          (100 * (statModulesHashed + statModulesFromCache)) / this.modules.size
        ) / 100
      } variants per module in average)`
    );
    this.hooks.afterModuleHash.call(); // This is where the hook is called
  }

  // ...
}
```

This snippet shows the definition of the `afterModuleHash` hook and where it is called within the `createModuleHashes` method of the `Compilation` class.

### `compilation.hooks.beforeCodeGeneration`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.beforeCodeGeneration` is a [SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L116) provided by the [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L134) class in Webpack. This hook is called right before the code generation process begins.

#### How to use it:
To use this hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.beforeCodeGeneration.tap('MyPlugin', () => {
        console.log('Before code generation');
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### How it works:
When Webpack is about to start the code generation phase, it triggers the `beforeCodeGeneration` hook. Any functions tapped into this hook will be executed synchronously at this point.

#### What it's for:
This hook is useful for performing any necessary actions or modifications right before the code generation process starts. This could include logging, modifying internal state, or preparing resources needed for code generation.

#### Example:
Here is a more detailed example of using the `beforeCodeGeneration` hook in a custom Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class CustomCodeGenPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('CustomCodeGenPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.beforeCodeGeneration.tap('CustomCodeGenPlugin', () => {
        console.log('Custom actions before code generation');
        // Perform custom actions here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = CustomCodeGenPlugin;
```

#### Parameters:
The `beforeCodeGeneration` hook does not accept any parameters. It is simply a signal that the code generation process is about to start.

#### Relevant Code:

  constructor(compiler, params) {
    this.hooks = {
      // ...
      beforeCodeGeneration: new SyncHook([]),
      // ...
    };
  }

  // ...
  createHash() {
    this.logger.time("code generation");
    this.hooks.beforeCodeGeneration.call();
    this.codeGeneration();
    this.hooks.afterCodeGeneration.call();
  }
  // ...
}
```

This snippet shows the definition of the `beforeCodeGeneration` hook and where it is called within the `createHash` method of the `Compilation` class.

### `compilation.hooks.afterCodeGeneration`

#### What it's for:
The `afterCodeGeneration` hook in the Webpack [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L134) class is used to perform actions after the code generation phase has completed. This phase involves generating the final code for each module in the compilation.

#### How it works:
The `afterCodeGeneration` hook is a synchronous hook ([SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L116)) that gets called with no arguments. It is triggered after the code generation process for all modules has finished.

#### How to use it:
To use the `afterCodeGeneration` hook, you need to tap into it using the [tap](https://github.com/webpack/tapable) method provided by Webpack's tapable library. This allows you to run custom code after the code generation phase.

#### Example:
Here is an example of how to use the `afterCodeGeneration` hook in a Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterCodeGeneration.tap('MyPlugin', () => {
        console.log('Code generation is complete!');
        // Add your custom logic here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in their callbacks:
The `afterCodeGeneration` hook does not accept any parameters in its callback.

#### Relevant Code:
The `afterCodeGeneration` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the codebase:

### `compilation.hooks.beforeRuntimeRequirements`

#### What it's for
The `beforeRuntimeRequirements` hook in the Webpack [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L134) class is used to perform actions or modifications right before the runtime requirements are processed. This hook allows plugins to add custom logic or modify the compilation state before the runtime requirements are finalized.

#### How it works
The `beforeRuntimeRequirements` hook is a synchronous hook ([SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#synchook)) that is triggered before the runtime requirements are processed. It does not accept any parameters in its callback function.

#### How to use it
To use the `beforeRuntimeRequirements` hook, you need to tap into it within a plugin. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.beforeRuntimeRequirements.tap('MyPlugin', () => {
        console.log('Before runtime requirements are processed');
        // Your custom logic here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Example
Here is a more detailed example of using the `beforeRuntimeRequirements` hook:

```javascript
class AddRuntimeRequirementPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('AddRuntimeRequirementPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.beforeRuntimeRequirements.tap('AddRuntimeRequirementPlugin', () => {
        console.log('Adding custom runtime requirement');
        // Add a custom runtime requirement
        // (Assuming addRuntimeRequirement is a method on the compilation object)
        compilation.addRuntimeRequirement('myCustomRuntimeRequirement');
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = AddRuntimeRequirementPlugin;
```

### Parameters
The `beforeRuntimeRequirements` hook does not provide any parameters to its callback function. It is simply a signal that the runtime requirements are about to be processed, allowing you to perform any necessary actions at that point.

### Relevant Code
The `beforeRuntimeRequirements` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the codebase:

```typescript
// types/Compilation.d.ts
export class Compilation {
  // ...
  beforeRuntimeRequirements: SyncHook<[]>;
  // ...
}

// lib/Compilation.js
class Compilation {
  constructor(compiler, params) {
    this.hooks = {
      // ...
      beforeRuntimeRequirements: new SyncHook([]),
      // ...
    };
  }

  // Example usage within the compilation process
  processRuntimeRequirements() {
    this.hooks.beforeRuntimeRequirements.call();
    // ... rest of the method
  }
}
```

In the `Compilation` class, the `beforeRuntimeRequirements` hook is defined as a `SyncHook` and called within the `processRuntimeRequirements` method, right before processing the runtime requirements.

### `compilation.hooks.afterRuntimeRequirements`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.afterRuntimeRequirements` is a [SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#synchook) provided by the Webpack [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types.d.ts#L1774) class. This hook is called after the runtime requirements for modules, chunks, and entries have been processed.

#### How to use it:
To use this hook, you need to tap into it using the [tap](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#tap) method. This allows you to execute custom logic after the runtime requirements have been processed.

#### How it works:
When Webpack processes the runtime requirements, it goes through modules, chunks, and entries to determine what runtime features are needed. After this process is complete, the `afterRuntimeRequirements` hook is called. You can use this hook to perform any additional operations that need to occur after the runtime requirements have been finalized.

#### What it's for:
This hook is useful for plugins or custom logic that need to perform actions after the runtime requirements have been fully processed. It ensures that all necessary runtime requirements have been accounted for before executing your custom logic.

#### Example:
Here is an example of how to tap into the `afterRuntimeRequirements` hook:

```javascript
class MyCustomPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterRuntimeRequirements.tap('MyCustomPlugin', () => {
        console.log('Runtime requirements have been processed.');
        // Add your custom logic here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyCustomPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in their callbacks:
The `afterRuntimeRequirements` hook does not provide any parameters to its callbacks. It is simply a signal that the runtime requirements processing is complete.

#### Relevant Code Snippets:

From the `types/Compilation.d.ts` file:

```typescript
export class Compilation {
  // Other hooks and properties...
  beforeRuntimeRequirements: SyncHook<[]>;
  afterRuntimeRequirements: SyncHook<[]>;
  // More hooks and properties...
}
```

From the `lib/Compilation.js` file:

```javascript
class Compilation {
  constructor(compiler, params) {
    this.hooks = {
      // Other hooks...
      beforeRuntimeRequirements: new SyncHook([]),
      afterRuntimeRequirements: new SyncHook([]),
      // More hooks...
    };
  }

  processRuntimeRequirements() {
    this.hooks.beforeRuntimeRequirements.call();
    // Process runtime requirements for modules, chunks, and entries...
    this.hooks.afterRuntimeRequirements.call();
  }
}
```

In the `Compilation` class, the `afterRuntimeRequirements` hook is defined as a `SyncHook` and called within the `processRuntimeRequirements` method, right after processing the runtime requirements.

### `compilation.hooks.beforeHash`

#### What it's for:
The [beforeHash](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L127) hook in the [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js) class is a [SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#synchook) that is called before the compilation hash is created. This hook allows you to perform actions or modifications right before the hash generation process begins.

#### How to use it:
To use the `beforeHash` hook, you need to tap into it using the [tap](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#tap) method. This is typically done within a Webpack plugin.

### Example:

Here is an example of how to use the `beforeHash` hook in a custom Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyCustomPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.beforeHash.tap('MyCustomPlugin', () => {
        console.log('Before hash generation');
        // Perform custom actions here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyCustomPlugin;
```

### How it works:
The `beforeHash` hook is a part of the `Compilation` class's hooks. It is called synchronously before the hash for the compilation is generated. This allows plugins to perform any necessary actions or modifications before the hash is finalized.

### What it's for:
The `beforeHash` hook is useful for scenarios where you need to ensure certain actions are completed or certain states are set before the compilation hash is generated. This can be important for ensuring consistency and correctness in the build process.

### Parameters:
The `beforeHash` hook does not accept any parameters. It is simply a signal that the hash generation process is about to begin.

### Relevant code:
The `beforeHash` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here is the relevant code snippet:

From the `types/Compilation.d.ts` file:
```typescript
export class Compilation {
  // Other hooks and properties...
  beforeHash: SyncHook<[]>;
  // More hooks and properties...
}
```

From the `lib/Compilation.js` file:
```javascript
class Compilation {
  constructor(compiler, params) {
    this.hooks = {
      // Other hooks...
      beforeHash: new SyncHook([]),
      // More hooks...
    };
  }

  createHash() {
    this.hooks.beforeHash.call();
    // Hash creation logic...
  }
}
```

In the `Compilation` class, the `beforeHash` hook is defined as a `SyncHook` and called within the `createHash` method, right before the hash is generated. This allows plugins to execute custom logic at this specific point in the compilation process.

### `compilation.hooks.contentHash`

#### What it is:
The `compilation.hooks.contentHash` is a [SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L116) provided by the Webpack [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js) class. This hook is used to tap into the process of generating content hashes for chunks.

#### How to Use It:

To use the `contentHash` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.contentHash.tap('MyPlugin', (chunk) => {
        // Your custom logic here
        console.log(`Generating content hash for chunk: ${chunk.name}`);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

### How It Works:

The `contentHash` hook is called during the hashing phase of the compilation process. When Webpack generates hashes for chunks, this hook allows you to execute custom logic. This can be useful for modifying the hash generation process or for logging purposes.

### What It's For:

The primary purpose of the `contentHash` hook is to provide a way to customize or extend the content hash generation process for chunks. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to implement custom hashing logic or need to perform additional operations when content hashes are being generated.

### Example:

Here is a more detailed example that demonstrates how to use the `contentHash` hook to modify the hash of a chunk:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

class CustomHashPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('CustomHashPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.contentHash.tap('CustomHashPlugin', (chunk) => {
        const hash = crypto.createHash('md5');
        hash.update(chunk.name);
        chunk.hash = hash.digest('hex');
        console.log(`Custom hash for chunk ${chunk.name}: ${chunk.hash}`);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = CustomHashPlugin;
```

### Parameters the Hook Accepts:

The `contentHash` hook accepts a single parameter:

- **chunk**: The chunk for which the content hash is being generated. This is an instance of the `Chunk` class.

### Relevant Code Snippets:

The `contentHash` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the codebase:

From the `types/Compilation.d.ts` file:
```typescript
export class Compilation {
  // Other hooks and properties...
  contentHash: SyncHook<[Chunk]>;
  // More hooks and properties...
}
```

From the `lib/Compilation.js` file:
```javascript
class Compilation {
  constructor(compiler, params) {
    this.hooks = {
      // Other hooks...
      contentHash: new SyncHook(["chunk"]),
      // More hooks...
    };
  }

  createChunkHashes() {
    for (const chunk of this.chunks) {
      // Other hash creation logic...
      this.hooks.contentHash.call(chunk);
      // More hash creation logic...
    }
  }
}
```

This hook is part of the `Compilation` class and is used during the hashing phase to allow custom logic to be executed when content hashes are generated for chunks.

### `compilation.hooks.afterHash`

#### What it's for:
The `afterHash` hook in the Webpack [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js) class is a [SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#synchook) that is called after the compilation hash has been created. This hook allows plugins to perform actions or modifications after the hash generation process is complete.

#### How it works:
The `afterHash` hook is defined as a SyncHook in the `Compilation` class. It is triggered at the end of the [createHash](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js#L4371) method, which is responsible for generating the hash for the compilation. This hook does not pass any arguments to its listeners.

#### How to use it:
To use the `afterHash` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterHash.tap('MyPlugin', () => {
        console.log('The hash has been created.');
        // Perform additional actions here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Example:
In the example above, the `MyPlugin` class taps into the `afterHash` hook. When the hook is called, it logs a message to the console. You can replace the `console.log` statement with any other logic you need to execute after the hash is created.

#### Parameters:
The `afterHash` hook does not accept any parameters or provide any in its callbacks.

#### Relevant Code:
The `afterHash` hook is defined and used in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the provided code:

From the `types/Compilation.d.ts` file:
```typescript
export class Compilation {
  // Other hooks and properties...
  afterHash: SyncHook<[]>;
  // More hooks and properties...
}
```

From the `lib/Compilation.js` file:
```javascript
class Compilation {
  constructor(compiler, params) {
    this.hooks = {
      // Other hooks...
      afterHash: new SyncHook([]),
      // More hooks...
    };
  }

  createHash() {
    // Hash generation logic...
    this.logger.timeEnd("hashing: hash digest");
    this.hooks.afterHash.call();
    // More hash generation logic...
  }
}
```

This hook is part of the `Compilation` class and is used during the hash generation phase to allow custom logic to be executed after the hash is generated for the compilation.

### `compilation.hooks.recordHash`

#### What it's for
The `recordHash` hook is used to record the hash of the compilation. This is typically useful for scenarios such as caching, where you need to keep track of hash values to ensure content integrity and identify changes between builds.

#### How it works
The `recordHash` hook is a synchronous hook (`SyncHook`) that takes a single argument, which is the records object. When this hook is called, it allows you to perform operations related to recording the hash of the compilation.

#### How to use it
To use the `recordHash` hook, you need to tap into it using the `tap` method provided by the `SyncHook` class. Below is an example of how to use this hook in a Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.recordHash.tap('MyPlugin', (records) => {
        // Your logic to handle the recording of the hash
        console.log('Recording hash:', records);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Parameters
- `records`: The records object that contains information about the compilation. This object is where you can store or modify data related to the compilation's hash.

#### Example
Here is a complete example of how to use the `recordHash` hook in a Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.recordHash.tap('MyPlugin', (records) => {
        // Your logic to handle the recording of the hash
        console.log('Recording hash:', records);
        // Example: Store the hash in the records object
        records.compilationHash = compilation.hash;
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Relevant Code
The `recordHash` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the codebase:

From `types/Compilation.d.ts`:
```typescript
export class Compilation {
  // Other hooks and properties...
  recordHash: SyncHook<[any]>;
  // More hooks and properties...
}
```

From `lib/Compilation.js`:
```javascript
class Compilation {
  constructor(compiler, params) {
    this.hooks = {
      // Other hooks...
      recordHash: new SyncHook(['records']),
      // More hooks...
    };
  }

  createHash() {
    // Hash generation logic...
    this.hooks.recordHash.call(records);
    // More hash generation logic...
  }
}
```

This hook is part of the `Compilation` class and is used during the hash generation phase to allow custom logic to be executed when recording the hash for the compilation.

### `compilation.hooks.record`

The `record` hook in the `Compilation` class is a `SyncHook` that is used to record the state of the compilation. This hook is particularly useful for plugins that need to store or manipulate the state of the compilation process.

#### How to Use It

To use the `record` hook, you need to tap into it within a plugin. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.record.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation, records) => {
        // Your custom logic here
        console.log('Recording compilation state');
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### How It Works

The `record` hook is called with two arguments:
1. `compilation`: The current `Compilation` instance.
2. `records`: An object where the state of the compilation can be recorded.

When the `record` hook is tapped, the provided function is executed, allowing you to manipulate or store the state of the compilation.

#### What It's For

The `record` hook is used to capture the state of the compilation at a specific point in time. This is useful for scenarios where you need to persist the state of the compilation, such as for caching purposes or for debugging.

#### Example

Here is a more detailed example of using the `record` hook to store the state of the compilation:

```javascript
class RecordStatePlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('RecordStatePlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.record.tap('RecordStatePlugin', (compilation, records) => {
        // Store the state of the compilation
        records.myCustomState = {
          modules: Array.from(compilation.modules).map(module => module.identifier()),
          chunks: Array.from(compilation.chunks).map(chunk => chunk.name)
        };
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = RecordStatePlugin;
```

In this example, the `RecordStatePlugin` captures the identifiers of all modules and the names of all chunks in the compilation and stores them in the `records` object.

#### Parameters

- `compilation`: The current `Compilation` instance.
- `records`: An object where the state of the compilation can be recorded.

#### Relevant Code

The `record` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class:

```javascript
/** @type {SyncHook<[Compilation, any]>} */
record: new SyncHook(["compilation", "records"]),
```

It is used in the `Compiler` class when emitting and reading records:

```javascript
class Compiler {
  // Other code...

  emitRecords(callback) {
    if (!this.recordsOutputPath) return callback();
    const recordsOutputPath = this.recordsOutputPath;
    this.hooks.emitRecords.call(this.records);
    // Code to write the records to the file system...
  }

  readRecords(callback) {
    if (!this.recordsInputPath) return callback();
    const recordsInputPath = this.recordsInputPath;
    // Code to read the records from the file system...
    this.hooks.readRecords.call(this.records);
  }

  // Other code...
}
```

This shows how the `record` hook is part of the process of emitting and reading records in the Webpack compilation process.

### `compilation.hooks.beforeModuleAssets`

The `beforeModuleAssets` hook in the Webpack `Compilation` class is a `SyncHook` that is called before the assets for the modules are created.

  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.beforeModuleAssets.tap('MyPlugin', () => {
        console.log('Before module assets are created');
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

### How It Works

The `beforeModuleAssets` hook is a synchronous hook that allows you to perform actions right before the module assets are created. This can be useful for tasks such as logging, modifying assets, or performing any other preparatory steps.

### What It's For

This hook is primarily used for performing actions or modifications before the module assets are created. It provides a point in the compilation process where you can intervene and make changes or log information.

### Example

```javascript
class CustomAssetPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('CustomAssetPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.beforeModuleAssets.tap('CustomAssetPlugin', () => {
        console.log('Custom logic before module assets are created');
        // Add your custom logic here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = CustomAssetPlugin;
```

### Parameters the Hook Accepts or Provides in Their Callbacks

The `beforeModuleAssets` hook does not provide any parameters to its callback function. It is simply a signal that the point in the compilation process has been reached.

```typescript
/** @type {SyncHook<[]>} */
beforeModuleAssets: new SyncHook([]),
```

This hook is part of the various hooks provided by the `Compilation` class to manage different stages and aspects of the compilation process.

### `compilation.hooks.shouldGenerateChunkAssets`

The `shouldGenerateChunkAssets` hook in the Webpack `Compilation` class is a `SyncBailHook` that allows you to conditionally determine whether chunk assets should be generated during the compilation process.

### How to Use It

To use the `shouldGenerateChunkAssets` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how you can use it:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.shouldGenerateChunkAssets.tap('MyPlugin', () => {
        // Your logic to determine if chunk assets should be generated
        const shouldGenerate = /* some condition */;
        return shouldGenerate;
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

### How It Works

- **Hook Type**: `SyncBailHook`
- **Parameters**: This hook does not take any parameters.
- **Return Value**: Returning `true` will allow chunk assets to be generated, while returning `false` will prevent their generation.

### What It's For

This hook is useful when you need to conditionally control the generation of chunk assets based on custom logic. For example, you might want to skip generating chunk assets in certain environments or under specific conditions.

### Example

Here is a more detailed example:

```javascript
class ConditionalChunkAssetPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('ConditionalChunkAssetPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.shouldGenerateChunkAssets.tap('ConditionalChunkAssetPlugin', () => {
        // Only generate chunk assets if the environment is production
        return process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = ConditionalChunkAssetPlugin;
```

### Parameters the Hook Accepts or Provides in Their Callbacks

The `shouldGenerateChunkAssets` hook does not accept any parameters in its callback. The decision to generate chunk assets is based on the logic you provide within the callback function.

### Relevant Code Snippet

The definition of the `shouldGenerateChunkAssets` hook can be found in the `lib/Compilation.js` file:

```javascript
shouldGenerateChunkAssets: new SyncBailHook([]),
```

This hook is part of the Webpack compilation lifecycle and provides a way to control the generation of chunk assets programmatically.

This hook is part of the `Compilation` class's `hooks` object, which contains various hooks for different stages of the compilation process.


### `compilation.hooks.beforeChunkAssets`

The `beforeChunkAssets` hook is a part of the `Compilation` class in Webpack. This hook is a `SyncHook` that is called before the assets for chunks are created.

### Details

- **Type**: `SyncHook`
- **Purpose**: To allow plugins to perform actions before the chunk assets are created.
- **Usage**: Typically used by plugins to manipulate or inspect the state of the compilation before chunk assets are generated.

### How to Use

To use the `beforeChunkAssets` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.beforeChunkAssets.tap('MyPlugin', () => {
        console.log('Before chunk assets are created');
        // Perform actions here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

### How It Works

When Webpack runs the compilation process, it will call the `beforeChunkAssets` hook at the appropriate time. Any plugins that have tapped into this hook will have their callback functions executed.

### What It's For

The `beforeChunkAssets` hook is useful for plugins that need to perform operations or checks before the chunk assets are finalized. This can include tasks like modifying chunk properties, adding additional assets, or logging information.

### Example

Here is a more detailed example of a plugin using the `beforeChunkAssets` hook:

```javascript
class LogChunkNamesPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('LogChunkNamesPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.beforeChunkAssets.tap('LogChunkNamesPlugin', () => {
        compilation.chunks.forEach(chunk => {
          console.log(`Chunk name: ${chunk.name}`);
        });
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = LogChunkNamesPlugin;
```

In this example, the `LogChunkNamesPlugin` logs the names of all chunks before their assets are created.

### Parameters

The `beforeChunkAssets` hook does not accept any parameters. It is simply a signal that the compilation process is at the stage where chunk assets are about to be created.

### Relevant Code Snippets

The `beforeChunkAssets` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the codebase:

```typescript
140:140:types/Compilation.d.ts
beforeChunkAssets: SyncHook<[]>;
```

```javascript
836:836:lib/Compilation.js
afterSeal: new AsyncSeriesHook([]),
```

This hook is part of the `Compilation` class and is used internally by Webpack to manage the build process.

### `compilation.hooks.additionalChunkAssets`

#### What it is
`compilation.hooks.additionalChunkAssets` is a deprecated hook in the Webpack compilation process. It is used to tap into the process of adding additional assets to chunks during the compilation.

#### How to use it
This hook is typically used by plugins that need to add or manipulate assets related to chunks during the compilation process. However, it is deprecated and should be replaced with `compilation.hooks.processAssets` with the appropriate stage.

#### How it works
The hook allows you to register synchronous, asynchronous, or promise-based functions that will be called during the asset processing phase. These functions can add, modify, or remove assets from the chunks.

#### What it's for
This hook is used for adding additional assets to chunks, such as source maps, additional files, or any other assets that need to be included in the final output.

#### Examples
Here is an example of how you might have used `compilation.hooks.additionalChunkAssets`:

```javascript
compilation.hooks.additionalChunkAssets.tapAsync(
  'MyPlugin',
  (chunks, callback) => {
    // Add or modify assets here
    callback();
  }
);
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in their callbacks
- **chunks**: A set of chunks that are being processed.
- **callback**: A callback function to signal completion in asynchronous hooks.

#### Code Reference
The relevant code for `compilation.hooks.additionalChunkAssets` can be found in the following lines:

```typescript
1777:1781:types.d.ts
additionalChunkAssets: FakeHook<
    Pick<
        AsyncSeriesHook<[Set<Chunk>]>,
        "name" | "tap" | "tapAsync" | "tapPromise"
    >
>
```

#### Deprecation Notice
This hook is deprecated and should be replaced with `compilation.hooks.processAssets` with the appropriate stage option. The stages can be found in the `Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_*` constants.

#### Replacement Example
Here is how you can replace the deprecated hook with `compilation.hooks.processAssets`:

```javascript
const { Compilation } = require('webpack');

class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.processAssets.tapAsync(
        {
          name: 'MyPlugin',
          stage: Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONAL,
        },
        (assets, callback) => {
          // Add or modify assets here
          console.log('Processing additional assets');
          callback();
        }
      );
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

In this example, `compilation.hooks.additionalChunkAssets` is replaced with `compilation.hooks.processAssets` with the `stage` option set to `Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONAL`. This ensures that the additional chunk assets are processed in the correct stage of the compilation lifecycle.

### `compilation.hooks.additionalAssets`

The `compilation.hooks.additionalAssets` hook is deprecated and should not be used in new code. Instead, you should use the `compilation.hooks.processAssets` hook with the appropriate stage.

### How to Use It
To use the `compilation.hooks.additionalAssets` hook, you would typically tap into it during the plugin's [apply](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/test/configCases/process-assets/html-plugin/webpack.config.js#13%2C2-13%2C2) method. However, since it is deprecated, it is recommended to use `compilation.hooks.processAssets` with the [PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONAL](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/test/configCases/process-assets/html-plugin/webpack.config.js#46%2C25-46%2C25) stage.

### How It Works
The `compilation.hooks.additionalAssets` hook was used to add additional assets to the compilation. It is an asynchronous series hook, meaning it can handle asynchronous tasks and will run each registered callback in series.

### What It's For
This hook was used to add additional assets to the compilation after the initial assets were processed but before the optimization stages. It allowed plugins to introduce new assets that were not part of the original compilation.

### Example
Here is an example of how you might have used the deprecated `compilation.hooks.additionalAssets` hook:

```javascript
const { RawSource } = require('webpack-sources');

class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.additionalAssets.tapAsync('MyPlugin', (callback) => {
        // Add additional assets here
        compilation.emitAsset('new-asset.txt', new RawSource('Hello, World!'));
        callback();
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

### Recommended Approach
Instead of using the deprecated hook, use `compilation.hooks.processAssets` with the `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONAL` stage:

```javascript
const { Compilation } = require('webpack');
const { RawSource } = require('webpack-sources');

class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.processAssets.tapAsync(
        {
          name: 'MyPlugin',
          stage: Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONAL,
        },
        (assets, callback) => {
          // Add additional assets here
          compilation.emitAsset('new-asset.txt', new RawSource('Hello, World!'));
          callback();
        }
      );
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

### Parameters the Hook Accepts or Provides in Callbacks
- **callback**: A function to be called when the additional assets have been added. This is used to signal that the asynchronous task is complete.

### Relevant Code Snippet
The `compilation.hooks.additionalAssets` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here is the relevant code snippet:

```typescript
144:148:types/Compilation.d.ts
additionalAssets: FakeHook<
  Pick<AsyncSeriesHook<[], import("tapable").UnsetAdditionalOptions>, "name" | "tap" | "tapAsync" | "tapPromise">
>;
/** @deprecated */
optimizeChunkAssets: FakeHook<
  Pick<AsyncSeriesHook<[Set<Chunk>], import("tapable").UnsetAdditionalOptions>, "name" | "tapAsync" | "tapPromise">
>;
```

And its usage in the `Compilation` class:

```javascript
823:826:lib/Compilation.js
optimizeAssets: processAssetsHook,
// TODO webpack 6 deprecate
/** @deprecated */
afterOptimizeAssets: afterProcessAssetsHook,
```

This demonstrates how the hook was defined and where it fits within the Webpack compilation process. For new code, always prefer `compilation.hooks.processAssets` with the appropriate stage to ensure compatibility with future Webpack versions.

### `compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkAssets`

The `compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkAssets` hook is part of the Webpack compilation process. It is used to optimize the assets of chunks during the compilation. This hook is deprecated and will be removed in Webpack 6. Instead, the `compilation.hooks.processAssets` hook should be used with the appropriate stage option.

### How to Use It

To use the [optimizeChunkAssets](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1787%2C3-1787%2C3) hook, you need to tap into it within a plugin. Here is an example of how to use it:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkAssets.tapAsync('MyPlugin', (chunks, callback) => {
        // Your optimization logic here
        callback();
      });
    });
  }
}
```

### How It Works

The `optimizeChunkAssets` hook allows you to perform custom optimizations on the assets of chunks. It is called during the optimization phase of the compilation process. The hook provides the chunks to be optimized and a callback function to signal when the optimization is complete.

### What It's For

This hook is used for optimizing the assets of chunks, such as minifying JavaScript files, optimizing images, or performing other asset transformations.

### Examples

Here is an example of using the `optimizeChunkAssets` hook to minify JavaScript files:

```javascript
const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');

class MinifyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MinifyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeChunkAssets.tapAsync('MinifyPlugin', (chunks, callback) => {
        chunks.forEach(chunk => {
          chunk.files.forEach(file => {
            const asset = compilation.assets[file];
            const minified = TerserPlugin.minify(asset.source());
            compilation.assets[file] = {
              source: () => minified.code,
              size: () => minified.code.length
            };
          });
        });
        callback();
      });
    });
  }
}
```

### Parameters the Hook Accepts or Provides in Their Callbacks

- **chunks**: An array of chunks to be optimized.
- **callback**: A function to be called when the optimization is complete.

### Relevant Code Block

The `optimizeChunkAssets` hook is defined in the `lib/Compilation.js` file:

```javascript
808:814:lib/Compilation.js
optimizeChunkAssets: createProcessAssetsHook(
  "optimizeChunkAssets",
  Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE,
  () => [this.chunks],
  "DEP_WEBPACK_COMPILATION_OPTIMIZE_CHUNK_ASSETS"
),
// TODO webpack 6 remove
```

This hook is deprecated and will be removed in Webpack 6. It is recommended to use the `compilation.hooks.processAssets` hook with the appropriate stage option instead. Here's how you can use the recommended approach:

### Recommended Approach

Use `compilation.hooks.processAssets` with the `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE` stage:

```javascript
const { Compilation } = require('webpack');
const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');

class MinifyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MinifyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.processAssets.tapAsync(
        {
          name: 'MinifyPlugin',
          stage: Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE,
        },
        (assets, callback) => {
          Object.keys(assets).forEach(file => {
            const asset = assets[file];
            const minified = TerserPlugin.minify(asset.source());
            compilation.updateAsset(file, new RawSource(minified.code));
          });
          callback();
        }
      );
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MinifyPlugin;
```

This approach ensures compatibility with future Webpack versions and adheres to the updated API.

### `compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeChunkAssets`

#### What it is
`compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeChunkAssets` is a hook in the Webpack compilation process. It is triggered after the chunk assets have been optimized. This hook is part of the optimization phase in the Webpack build lifecycle.

#### How to use it
To use this hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. You can use the [tap](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/optimize/MinChunkSizePlugin.js#41%2C30-41%2C30), [tapAsync](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#149%2C140-149%2C140), or [tapPromise](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#149%2C153-149%2C153) methods to register your callback function.

#### How it works
This hook allows you to perform additional operations or modifications on the chunk assets after they have been optimized. It is a synchronous hook, meaning the registered callbacks are executed in sequence and must complete before the next hook in the lifecycle is called.

#### What it's for
This hook is useful for plugins that need to perform final adjustments or logging after the chunk assets have been optimized. It provides a point in the build process where you can inspect or modify the optimized assets.

#### Example
Here is an example of how to use the [afterOptimizeChunkAssets](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#149%2C9-149%2C9) hook in a custom Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyCustomPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeChunkAssets.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (chunks) => {
        console.log('Chunks have been optimized:', chunks);
        // Perform additional operations on the optimized chunks
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyCustomPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in their callbacks
The `afterOptimizeChunkAssets` hook provides the following parameter to its callbacks:
- `chunks`: An iterable of the optimized chunks.

#### Relevant Code Snippet

The `afterOptimizeChunkAssets` hook is defined in the `lib/Compilation.js` file:

```javascript
816:822:lib/Compilation.js
afterOptimizeChunkAssets: createProcessAssetsHook(
  "afterOptimizeChunkAssets",
  Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE + 1,
  () => [this.chunks],
  "DEP_WEBPACK_COMPILATION_AFTER_OPTIMIZE_CHUNK_ASSETS"
),
// TODO webpack 6 deprecate
```

This snippet shows the definition of the `afterOptimizeChunkAssets` hook within the `Compilation` class. Note that this hook is scheduled for deprecation in Webpack 6, and it is recommended to use `compilation.hooks.processAssets` with the appropriate stage instead.

### `compilation.hooks.optimizeAssets`

#### What it's for
The `optimizeAssets` hook in Webpack's `Compilation` class is used to optimize the assets before they are emitted. This hook allows plugins to perform various optimizations on the assets, such as minification, compression, or any other transformation that can improve the performance or reduce the size of the assets.

#### How it works
The `optimizeAssets` hook is a part of the asset processing pipeline in Webpack. It is an instance of `AsyncSeriesHook`, which means it runs asynchronously and in series. Plugins can tap into this hook to perform their optimizations on the assets.

#### How to use it
To use the `optimizeAssets` hook, you need to tap into it from within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to use this hook in a custom Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyOptimizationPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyOptimizationPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeAssets.tapAsync('MyOptimizationPlugin', (assets, callback) => {
        // Perform optimizations on assets
        for (const assetName in assets) {
          if (Object.hasOwnProperty.call(assets, assetName)) {
            const asset = assets[assetName];
            // Example optimization: Minify the asset content
            const minifiedContent = minify(asset.source());
            assets[assetName] = {
              source: () => minifiedContent,
              size: () => minifiedContent.length,
            };
          }
        }
        callback();
      });
    });
  }
}

function minify(content) {
  // Example minification logic
  return content.replace(/\s+/g, ' ');
}

module.exports = MyOptimizationPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in its callbacks
- **assets**: An object containing all the assets to be emitted. The keys are the asset names, and the values are objects with `source` and `size` methods.
- **callback**: A function to be called when the optimization is complete. This is used to signal Webpack to proceed with the next step in the compilation process.

#### Example
Here is an example of a plugin that uses the `optimizeAssets` hook to minify HTML assets:

```javascript
class HtmlMinimizePlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('HtmlMinimizePlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.optimizeAssets.tapAsync('HtmlMinimizePlugin', (assets, callback) => {
        for (const name of Object.keys(assets)) {
          if (/\.html$/.test(name)) {
            const asset = assets[name];
            const minifiedContent = asset.source().replace(/\s+/g, ' ');
            assets[name] = {
              source: () => minifiedContent,
              size: () => minifiedContent.length,
            };
          }
        }
        callback();
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = HtmlMinimizePlugin;
```

This plugin will minify all HTML assets by removing extra whitespace.

          additionalAssets: true
        },
        assets => {
          for (const name of Object.keys(assets)) {
            if (/\.html$/.test(name)) {
              compilation.updateAsset(
                name,
                source => new RawSource(source.source().replace(/\s+/g, ' ')),
                assetInfo => ({
                  ...assetInfo,
                  minimized: true
                })
              );
            }
          }
        }
      );
    });
  }
}

module.exports = HtmlMinimizePlugin;
```

### `compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeAssets`

The `compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeAssets` is a hook provided by the Webpack [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/optimize/RealContentHashPlugin.js#160%2C13-160%2C13) class. This hook is part of the asset optimization process and is triggered after the assets have been optimized.

### How to Use It

To use the [afterOptimizeAssets](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#155%2C9-155%2C9) hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeAssets.tap('MyPlugin', (assets) => {
        // Your custom logic here
        console.log('Assets have been optimized:', assets);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

### How It Works

- **Purpose**: The `afterOptimizeAssets` hook allows you to perform actions after Webpack has optimized the assets. This can be useful for tasks such as further modifying the optimized assets, logging, or performing custom optimizations.
- **Trigger Point**: This hook is called after the `optimizeAssets` hook and any other asset optimization hooks have been executed.
- **Parameters**: The hook provides the `assets` parameter, which is an object containing all the assets that have been optimized.

### What It's For

The `afterOptimizeAssets` hook is primarily used for:

- **Post-Optimization Modifications**: Making additional changes to the assets after Webpack's built-in optimizations.
- **Logging and Debugging**: Logging information about the optimized assets for debugging or analysis.
- **Custom Optimizations**: Implementing custom optimization logic that needs to run after Webpack's default optimizations.

### Example

Here is a more detailed example that demonstrates how to use the `afterOptimizeAssets` hook to log the names of all optimized assets:

```javascript
class LogOptimizedAssetsPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('LogOptimizedAssetsPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeAssets.tap('LogOptimizedAssetsPlugin', (assets) => {
        console.log('Optimized assets:');
        for (const assetName in assets) {
          console.log(assetName);
        }
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = LogOptimizedAssetsPlugin;
```

### `compilation.hooks.processAssets`

#### What it's for
The [processAssets](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1804%2C3-1804%2C3) hook in the [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#5487%2C1-5487%2C1) class is used to process and manipulate assets during the compilation process in Webpack. This hook allows plugins to add, modify, or optimize assets before they are emitted.

#### How it works
The [processAssets](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1804%2C3-1804%2C3) hook is an [AsyncSeriesHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1780%2C5-1780%2C5) that takes [CompilationAssets](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1800%2C5-1800%2C5) as its argument. It provides various stages at which plugins can tap into the asset processing pipeline. This hook is part of a series of hooks that manage the lifecycle of asset processing, including [processAdditionalAssets](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1809%2C3-1809%2C3), [optimizeAssets](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1799%2C3-1799%2C3), and [afterProcessAssets](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1808%2C3-1808%2C3).

#### How to use it
To use the [processAssets](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1804%2C3-1804%2C3) hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. You can specify the stage at which your plugin should run and whether it should handle additional assets.

#### Parameters
- **assets**: The [CompilationAssets](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1800%2C5-1800%2C5) object containing all the assets to be processed.
- **additionalAssets**: An optional parameter that can be a boolean or a function, indicating whether additional assets should be processed.

#### Example
Here is an example of how to use the [processAssets](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types.d.ts#1804%2C3-1804%2C3) hook in a Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.processAssets.tapAsync(
        {
          name: 'MyPlugin',
          stage: Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE,
          additionalAssets: true
        },
        (assets, callback) => {
          // Process the assets here
          for (const assetName in assets) {
            if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(assets, assetName)) {
              const asset = assets[assetName];
              // Modify the asset source
              const newSource = new RawSource(`/* MyPlugin */\n${asset.source()}`);
              compilation.updateAsset(assetName, newSource);
            }
          }
          callback();
        }
      );
    });
  }
}
```

#### Relevant Code
The `processAssets` hook is defined and used in the following parts of the codebase:

```javascript
442:560:lib/Compilation.js
/** @type {AsyncSeriesHook<[CompilationAssets], ProcessAssetsAdditionalOptions>} */

            return p.then(() => {
              if (processedAssets !== undefined) processedAssets.add(this.assets);
              const newAssets = popNewAssets(assets);
              if (newAssets !== undefined) {
                return this.hooks.processAdditionalAssets.promise(newAssets);
              }
            });
          }
        };
    }
  }
});
```

```typescript
1803:1806:types.d.ts

```

```typescript
155:157:types/Compilation.d.ts
processAssets: AsyncSeriesHook<[CompilationAssets], {
  additionalAssets?: true | Function;
}>;
```

#### Stages
The `processAssets` hook supports various stages, which are defined as static properties on the `Compilation` class. These stages allow you to control the order in which your plugin runs relative to other plugins. Some of the stages include:

- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONAL`
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_PRE_PROCESS`
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_DERIVED`
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONS`
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE`

- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE_COMPATIBILITY`
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE_SIZE`
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_DEV_TOOLING`
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE_INLINE`
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_SUMMARIZE`
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE_HASH`
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE_TRANSFER`
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ANALYSE`
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_REPORT`

These stages are defined in the following part of the codebase:

```javascript

### `compilation.hooks.afterProcessAssets`

#### What it is:
`compilation.hooks.afterProcessAssets` is a [SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L1807) provided by Webpack's [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js#L5487) class. This hook is called after the [processAssets](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L1804) hook has completed its execution.

#### How to use it:
To use `compilation.hooks.afterProcessAssets`, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. This allows you to perform actions after all assets have been processed.

#### How it works:
The [afterProcessAssets](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L1808) hook is triggered synchronously after the [processAssets](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L1804) hook. It provides the final state of the assets, allowing plugins to perform any final modifications or logging.

#### What it's for:
This hook is useful for performing final adjustments or clean-up tasks on the assets after all processing stages have been completed. It ensures that all previous asset processing hooks have finished their work.

#### Example:
Here is an example of how to use `compilation.hooks.afterProcessAssets` in a Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterProcessAssets.tap('MyPlugin', (assets) => {
        console.log('All assets have been processed.');
        // Perform final adjustments or logging
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Parameters:
- **assets**: The `CompilationAssets` object, which contains all the assets generated during the compilation process.

#### Relevant Code:

The `afterProcessAssets` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class as follows:

```javascript
828:831:lib/Compilation.js
processAssets: processAssetsHook,
afterProcessAssets: afterProcessAssetsHook,
/** @type {AsyncSeriesHook<[CompilationAssets]>} */
processAdditionalAssets: new AsyncSeriesHook(["assets"]),
```

The hook is defined in the type definitions here:

```typescript
1807:1807:types.d.ts
afterProcessAssets: SyncHook<[CompilationAssets]>;
```

Another relevant type definition:

```typescript
158:158:types/Compilation.d.ts
afterProcessAssets: SyncHook<[CompilationAssets], void, import("tapable").UnsetAdditionalOptions>;
```

By tapping into the `afterProcessAssets` hook, you can ensure that your plugin performs its actions after all other asset processing is complete, making it an ideal place for final modifications or logging.

### `compilation.hooks.needAdditionalSeal`

#### What it is
`compilation.hooks.needAdditionalSeal` is a [SyncBailHook](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L1810) in the Webpack compilation process. This hook is used to determine if an additional sealing pass is required for the compilation.

#### How to Use It

You can tap into this hook to add custom logic that decides whether an additional seal is needed. If any plugin returns `true` from this hook, Webpack will perform another sealing pass.

#### How It Works

The `needAdditionalSeal` hook is called during the sealing process of the compilation. If any registered plugin returns `true`, the compilation will unseal and then reseal itself, allowing for additional processing.

#### What It's For

This hook is useful for plugins that need to perform additional operations after the initial sealing of the compilation. For example, if a plugin modifies assets or chunks in a way that requires another pass of the sealing process, it can use this hook to trigger that additional pass.

#### Example

Here is an example of how to use the `needAdditionalSeal` hook in a Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.needAdditionalSeal.tap('MyPlugin', () => {
        // Custom logic to determine if an additional seal is needed
        const needsSeal = /* some condition */;
        return needsSeal;
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the Hook Accepts or Provides in Their Callbacks

The `needAdditionalSeal` hook does not accept any parameters and expects a boolean return value. If any plugin returns `true`, an additional seal will be performed.

#### Relevant Code Snippets

The `needAdditionalSeal` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class:

```typescript
1809:1810:types/Compilation.d.ts
needAdditionalSeal: SyncBailHook<[]>;
```

It is called during the sealing process:

```javascript
3203:3205:lib/Compilation.js
if (this.hooks.needAdditionalSeal.call()) {
  this.unseal();
  return this.seal(callback);
}
```

By tapping into the `needAdditionalSeal` hook, you can control whether an additional sealing pass is required based on custom conditions, providing flexibility for more complex build processes.

### `compilation.hooks.afterSeal`

#### What it is
The `compilation.hooks.afterSeal` is an [AsyncSeriesHook](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types.d.ts#L1780) in the Webpack compilation process. This hook is called after the compilation has been sealed, which means that all modules have been built, optimized, and the chunk graph has been created and optimized.

#### How to Use It

To use the [afterSeal](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Compilation.js#L3208) hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterSeal.tapAsync('MyPlugin', (callback) => {
        // Your custom logic here
        console.log('Compilation is sealed.');
        callback();
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### How It Works

The `afterSeal` hook allows you to run custom logic after the compilation process has been sealed. This is useful for tasks that need to be performed after all modules and chunks have been processed and optimized.

#### What It's For

The `afterSeal` hook is typically used for final adjustments or inspections of the compilation result. For example, you might use it to:

- Analyze the final chunk graph.
- Perform additional optimizations.
- Generate custom reports or logs.

#### Example

Here is an example of using the `afterSeal` hook to log the names of all chunks in the compilation:

```javascript
class LogChunksPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('LogChunksPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.afterSeal.tapAsync('LogChunksPlugin', (callback) => {
        console.log('Chunks:', Array.from(compilation.chunks).map(chunk => chunk.name));
        callback();
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = LogChunksPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the Hook Accepts or Provides in Callbacks

The `afterSeal` hook does not accept any parameters in its callback. The callback is a standard Node.js-style callback function that you must call when your custom logic is complete.

#### Relevant Code Snippet

Here is the relevant code snippet from the provided codebase:

```typescript
163:164:types/Compilation.d.ts
/** @type {AsyncSeriesHook<[]>} */
afterSeal: AsyncSeriesHook<[]>;
```

```javascript
836:838:lib/Compilation.js
afterSeal: new AsyncSeriesHook([]),
/** @type {SyncWaterfallHook<[RenderManifestEntry[], RenderManifestOptions]>} */
```

```javascript
23:23:test/configCases/chunk-index/order-multiple-entries/webpack.config.js
compilation.hooks.afterSeal.tap(
```

The `afterSeal` hook is an essential part of the Webpack compilation lifecycle, providing a convenient point for final processing and inspection of the compiled assets. By using this hook, you can ensure that all necessary adjustments and optimizations are made before the assets are emitted.

### `compilation.hooks.renderManifest`

#### What it's for
The `renderManifest` hook in the [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/MainTemplate.js#L45) class is used to generate the render manifest for a chunk. This manifest contains information about how the chunk should be rendered, including the assets that need to be created.

#### How it works
The `renderManifest` hook is called with an empty array and a [RenderManifestOptions](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/Template.js#L44) object. Plugins can tap into this hook to add entries to the render manifest. Each entry in the render manifest describes an asset that should be generated for the chunk.

#### How to use it
To use the `renderManifest` hook, you need to tap into it within a plugin. You can add entries to the render manifest by pushing objects into the array passed to the hook.

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in their callbacks
- **entries**: An array to which render manifest entries should be added.
- **options**: An object containing various options for rendering the manifest. This includes:
    - `chunk`: The chunk used to render.
    - `hash`: The hash of the compilation.
    - `fullHash`: The full hash of the compilation.
    - `outputOptions`: The output options for the compilation.
    - `codeGenerationResults`: The results of code generation.
    - `moduleTemplates`: The module templates used in the compilation.
    - `dependencyTemplates`: The dependency templates used in the compilation.
    - `runtimeTemplate`: The runtime template used in the compilation.
    - `moduleGraph`: The module graph of the compilation.
    - `chunkGraph`: The chunk graph of the compilation.

#### Example
Here is an example of how to tap into the `renderManifest` hook in a plugin:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.renderManifest.tap('MyPlugin', (entries, options) => {
        // Add a custom render manifest entry
        entries.push({
          render: () => new Source(),
          filenameTemplate: 'my-custom-file.js',
          pathOptions: {
            chunk: options.chunk,
          },
          identifier: `my-plugin-${options.chunk.id}`,
          hash: options.hash,
        });
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

#### Relevant Code
The `renderManifest` hook is defined and used in the `Compilation` class:

```javascript
// lib/Compilation.js
getRenderManifest(options) {
  return this.hooks.renderManifest.call([], options);
}
```

It is also referenced in the `MainTemplate` and `ChunkTemplate` classes:

```javascript
// lib/MainTemplate.js
renderManifest: {
  tap: util.deprecate(
    (options, fn) => {
      compilation.hooks.renderManifest.tap(
        options,
        (entries, options) => {
          if (!options.chunk.hasRuntime()) return entries;
          return fn(entries, options);
        }
      );
    },
    "MainTemplate.hooks.renderManifest is deprecated (use Compilation.hooks.renderManifest instead)",
    "DEP_WEBPACK_MAIN_TEMPLATE_RENDER_MANIFEST"
  )
}
```

```javascript
// lib/ChunkTemplate.js
renderManifest: {
  tap: util.deprecate(
    (options, fn) => {
      compilation.hooks.renderManifest.tap(
        options,
        (entries, options) => {
          if (options.chunk.hasRuntime()) return entries;
          return fn(entries, options);
        }
      );
    },
    "ChunkTemplate.hooks.renderManifest is deprecated (use Compilation.hooks.renderManifest instead)",
    "DEP_WEBPACK_CHUNK_TEMPLATE_RENDER_MANIFEST"
  )
}
```

### `compilation.hooks.fullHash`

The `compilation.hooks.fullHash` is a [SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/types/Compilation.d.ts#L116) provided by the Webpack [Compilation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/optimize/RealContentHashPlugin.js#L114) class. This hook is used to modify or extend the full hash of the compilation. The full hash is a unique identifier for the entire compilation, which changes whenever any part of the compilation changes.

### How to Use It

To use the `fullHash` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.fullHash.tap('MyPlugin', (hash) => {
        // Modify the hash
        hash.update('my-custom-hash');
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

### How It Works

The `fullHash` hook allows plugins to update the hash used for the entire compilation. This can be useful for adding custom data to the hash, ensuring that the hash changes when specific conditions are met.

### What It's For

The `fullHash` hook is primarily used to ensure cache invalidation. By updating the hash, you can make sure that the output files are correctly invalidated and reloaded when necessary.

### Parameters

- **hash**: An instance of the `Hash` class, which can be updated with custom data.

### Example

Here is a more detailed example:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.fullHash.tap('MyPlugin', (hash) => {
        // Add custom data to the hash
        hash.update('my-plugin-specific-data');
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

### Relevant Code Snippets

The `fullHash` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the codebase:

```typescript
// types.d.ts
fullHash: SyncHook<[Hash]>;
chunkHash: SyncHook<[Chunk, Hash, ChunkHashContext]>;

// Compilation.d.ts
contentHash: SyncHook<[Chunk]>;
/** @type {SyncHook<[]>} */

// Compilation.js
this.hooks.fullHash.call(hash);
this.fullHash = /** @type {string} */ (hash.digest(hashDigest));
```

These snippets show the definition of the `fullHash` hook and its usage within the Webpack compilation process.

### `compilation.hooks.chunkHash`

#### What it's for
The `compilation.hooks.chunkHash` is a hook in the Webpack compilation process. It is used to customize the hash generation for chunks. This hook is particularly useful when you need to influence the chunk hash based on custom logic or additional data.

#### How it works
The `chunkHash` hook allows you to modify the hash of a chunk. When Webpack generates the hash for a chunk, it calls this hook, passing the chunk, the hash object, and the context. You can then update the hash object with additional data, which will influence the final hash value of the chunk.

#### How to use it
To use the `chunkHash` hook, you need to tap into it during the compilation phase. This can be done in a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to use it:

```javascript
class MyCustomPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.chunkHash.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (chunk, hash, context) => {
        // Custom logic to influence the chunk hash
        hash.update('my-custom-data');
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyCustomPlugin;
```

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in their callbacks
- `chunk`: The chunk for which the hash is being generated.
- `hash`: The hash object that you can update with additional data.
- `context`: The context in which the hash is being generated.

#### What it's for
The `chunkHash` hook is used to ensure that the chunk hash reflects any custom data or logic you want to include. This is useful for cache busting, ensuring that changes in specific parts of your codebase result in different chunk hashes, and thus different filenames.

#### Example
Here is a more detailed example that demonstrates how to use the `chunkHash` hook to include the chunk name in the hash:

```javascript
class IncludeChunkNameInHashPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('IncludeChunkNameInHashPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.chunkHash.tap('IncludeChunkNameInHashPlugin', (chunk, hash, context) => {
        if (chunk.name) {
          hash.update(chunk.name);
        }
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = IncludeChunkNameInHashPlugin;
```

In this example, the chunk name is included in the hash, ensuring that different chunk names result in different hashes.

#### Relevant Code Snippet
The `chunkHash` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the codebase:

```typescript
// types.d.ts
chunkHash: SyncHook<[Chunk, Hash, ChunkHashContext]>;

// Compilation.d.ts
chunkHash: SyncHook<[Chunk, Hash, ChunkHashContext]>;

// Compilation.js
this.hooks.chunkHash.call(chunk, hash, context);
```

These snippets show the definition of the `chunkHash` hook and its usage within the Webpack compilation process.

### `compilation.hooks.moduleAsset`

#### What it's for
The [moduleAsset](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#173%2C9-173%2C9) hook in the [Compilation](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/asset/AssetGenerator.js#24%2C26-24%2C26) class is used to handle assets that are associated with modules. This hook is called whenever an asset is emitted for a module, allowing plugins to perform additional processing or logging.

#### How it works
The [moduleAsset](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#173%2C9-173%2C9) hook is a [SyncHook](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/types/Compilation.d.ts#172%2C20-172%2C20) that takes two parameters:
1. [module](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/asset/AssetModulesPlugin.js#238%2C1-238%2C1): The module for which the asset is being emitted.
2. [filename](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/asset/AssetModulesPlugin.js#198%2C10-198%2C10): The name of the emitted asset file.

This hook is triggered during the asset emission process, specifically when the [emitAsset](file:///Volumes/sandisk/lulu_dev/webpack/lib/Compilation.js#4678%2C11-4678%2C11) method is called for a module's asset.

#### How to use it
To use the `moduleAsset` hook, you need to tap into it within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.moduleAsset.tap('MyPlugin', (module, filename) => {
        console.log(`Asset ${filename} was emitted for module ${module.identifier()}`);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

In this example, the plugin logs a message every time an asset is emitted for a module.

#### Parameters the hook accepts
- `module`: The module instance for which the asset is being emitted.
- `filename`: The name of the emitted asset file.

#### Example
Here is a more detailed example that demonstrates how to use the `moduleAsset` hook to perform custom processing on emitted assets:

```javascript
class CustomAssetProcessingPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('CustomAssetProcessingPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.moduleAsset.tap('CustomAssetProcessingPlugin', (module, filename) => {
        // Custom processing logic for the emitted asset
        console.log(`Processing asset ${filename} for module ${module.identifier()}`);
        // For example, you could modify the asset content or metadata here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = CustomAssetProcessingPlugin;
```

In this example, the `CustomAssetProcessingPlugin` performs custom processing on each emitted asset, such as modifying the asset content or metadata.

#### Relevant Code
The `moduleAsset` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class and is called during the asset emission process. Here are the relevant lines from the codebase:

```javascript
// lib/Compilation.js
this.hooks.moduleAsset.call(module, fileName);

// types/Compilation.d.ts
moduleAsset: SyncHook<[Module, string]>;
```

### `compilation.hooks.chunkAsset`

#### What it's for
The `chunkAsset` hook is used to perform actions or modifications whenever an asset is added to a chunk during the compilation process. This can be useful for plugins that need to track or manipulate assets associated with chunks.

#### How it works
The `chunkAsset` hook is a synchronous hook ([SyncHook](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#synchook)) that is called with two arguments: the chunk and the filename of the asset being added. Plugins can tap into this hook to execute custom logic whenever an asset is added to a chunk.

#### Parameters
- **chunk**: The chunk to which the asset is being added. This is an instance of the `Chunk` class.
- **filename**: The name of the asset file being added to the chunk.

#### Example Usage
Here is an example of how to use the `chunkAsset` hook in a Webpack plugin:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.chunkAsset.tap('MyPlugin', (chunk, filename) => {
        console.log(`Asset ${filename} was added to chunk ${chunk.id}`);
        // Perform custom logic here
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

In this example, the plugin logs a message to the console whenever an asset is added to a chunk.

#### Relevant Code
The `chunkAsset` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here are the relevant lines from the codebase:

```javascript
// lib/Compilation.js
chunkAsset: new SyncHook(["chunk", "filename"]),
```

This hook is called within the `createChunkAssets` method when an asset is emitted:

```javascript
// lib/Compilation.js
chunk.files.add(file);
this.hooks.chunkAsset.call(chunk, file);
```

By tapping into this hook, plugins can execute custom logic whenever an asset is added to a chunk, allowing for a wide range of customizations and enhancements during the Webpack compilation process.

### `compilation.hooks.assetPath`

#### What it's for
The `assetPath` hook in the `Compilation` class is used to modify the asset path before it is emitted. This hook allows plugins to customize the path of assets, such as files, that are generated during the compilation process.

#### How it works
The `assetPath` hook is a `SyncWaterfallHook` that takes three arguments:
1. `path` (string): The initial path of the asset.
2. `options` (object): Options related to the asset.
3. `assetInfo` (AssetInfo | undefined): Information about the asset.

The hook allows plugins to intercept and modify the asset path by tapping into it.

#### Parameters the hook accepts or provides in their callbacks
- **path**: The initial path of the asset.
- **options**: An object containing options related to the asset.
- **assetInfo**: Information about the asset, which can be undefined.

#### Example
Here is an example of how to use the `assetPath` hook in a plugin to modify the asset path:

```javascript
class MyCustomPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.assetPath.tap('MyCustomPlugin', (path, options, assetInfo) => {
        // Modify the asset path
        return `custom/path/${path}`;
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyCustomPlugin;
```

In this example, the `MyCustomPlugin` modifies the asset path by prefixing it with `custom/path/`.

#### Code Reference
The `assetPath` hook is defined in the `Compilation` class as follows:

```javascript
// lib/Compilation.js
assetPath: new SyncWaterfallHook(["path", "options", "assetInfo"]),
```

This hook is part of the `hooks` object in the `Compilation` class, which contains various hooks for different stages of the compilation process.

The `needAdditionalPass` hook in Webpack is part of the compilation lifecycle. It is used to determine if an additional compilation pass is required. This can be useful in scenarios where plugins or loaders need to perform additional work after the initial compilation.

### How to Use It

You can tap into the `needAdditionalPass` hook within a Webpack plugin. Here is an example of how to use it:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.needAdditionalPass.tap('MyPlugin', () => {
        // Your logic to determine if an additional pass is needed
        console.log('Checking if additional pass is needed');
        return true; // Return true if an additional pass is needed
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

### How It Works

- **Hook Type**: `SyncBailHook`
- **Purpose**: To determine if an additional compilation pass is required.
- **When It Runs**: This hook is called during the compilation process, after the initial compilation has been completed.

### Parameters

The `needAdditionalPass` hook does not accept any parameters. It is a synchronous hook that expects a boolean return value:
- **Return `true`**: If an additional pass is needed.
- **Return `false` or `undefined`**: If no additional pass is needed.

### Example

Here is a more detailed example of a Webpack plugin using the `needAdditionalPass` hook:

```javascript
class CheckForAdditionalPassPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('CheckForAdditionalPassPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.needAdditionalPass.tap('CheckForAdditionalPassPlugin', () => {
        // Custom logic to determine if another pass is needed
        const needsPass = someConditionCheck();
        console.log(`Additional pass needed: ${needsPass}`);
        return needsPass;
      });
    });
  }
}

function someConditionCheck() {
  // Implement your condition check logic here
  return true; // or false based on your condition
}

module.exports = CheckForAdditionalPassPlugin;
```

### What It's For

The `needAdditionalPass` hook is particularly useful in complex build processes where certain conditions might necessitate re-running the compilation. This can include scenarios like:
- Dynamic dependency resolution
- Conditional asset generation
- Post-processing steps that might alter the output and require recompilation

By using this hook, you can ensure that your build process is flexible and can handle complex scenarios that require multiple passes.

          object.myCustomField = 'Custom Value';
          return object;
        });
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyStatsPrinterPlugin;
```

### How It Works

- **Hook Type**: `SyncHook`
- **Parameters**: The hook receives two parameters:
    - `statsPrinter`: The instance of the `StatsPrinter` class.
    - `options`: The normalized stats options.

The `statsPrinter` instance has its own hooks that you can tap into to customize the output. For example, you can tap into the `print` hook to modify how specific parts of the stats are printed.

### What It's For

The `statsPrinter` hook is used to customize the output of the Webpack compilation statistics. This can be useful for adding custom fields, modifying existing fields, or changing the format of the stats output.

### Examples

#### Adding a Custom Field to Asset Info

```javascript
compilation.hooks.statsPrinter.tap('MyStatsPrinterPlugin', (statsPrinter, options) => {
  statsPrinter.hooks.print.for('asset.info').tap('MyStatsPrinterPlugin', (object, data, context) => {
    object.customField = 'Custom Value';
    return object;
  });
});
```

#### Modifying the Output Format

```javascript
compilation.hooks.statsPrinter.tap('MyStatsPrinterPlugin', (statsPrinter, options) => {
  statsPrinter.hooks.print.for('module').tap('MyStatsPrinterPlugin', (object, data, context) => {
    object.customFormat = `Module: ${data.module.name}`;
    return object;
  });
});
```

### Parameters the Hook Accepts or Provides in Their Callbacks

- **statsPrinter**: The `StatsPrinter` instance.
- **options**: The normalized stats options.

The `statsPrinter` instance itself has hooks like `print` that accept parameters such as:
- **object**: The object that will be printed.
- **data**: The data related to the object being printed.
- **context**: The context in which the printing is happening.

By tapping into these hooks, you can modify the `object` before it is printed, allowing for extensive customization of the stats output.

### Code Reference

The `compilation.hooks.statsPrinter` is defined in the `Compilation` class. Here is the relevant code block:

```javascript
class Compilation {
  constructor() {
    this.hooks = {
      statsPrinter: new SyncHook(["statsPrinter", "options"]),
      /** @type {SyncHook<[StatsPrinter, NormalizedStatsOptions]>} */
    };
  }
}
```

This hook is part of the `hooks` object in the `Compilation` class, which is used to manage various lifecycle events during the compilation process.

The `compilation.hooks.normalModuleLoader` hook is a deprecated hook in Webpack's `Compilation` class. It was used to access the loader hooks for normal modules. This hook has been moved to `NormalModule.getCompilationHooks(compilation).loader`.

### How to Use It

To use the `normalModuleLoader` hook, you would typically tap into it within a Webpack plugin. However, since it is deprecated, you should use the new method `NormalModule.getCompilationHooks(compilation).loader`.

### How It Works

The `normalModuleLoader` hook was used to modify or extend the behavior of the module loader during the compilation process. It allowed plugins to tap into the loader process for normal modules.

### What It's For

This hook was primarily used for customizing the module loading process, such as adding custom loaders or modifying existing ones. It provided a way to interact with the module loading phase in Webpack's compilation lifecycle.

### Example

Here is an example of how you might have used the `normalModuleLoader` hook before it was deprecated:

```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.normalModuleLoader.tap('MyPlugin', (loaderContext, module) => {
        // Custom logic for the normal module loader
      });
    });
  }
}
```

### Parameters

- `loaderContext`: The context object for the loader.
- `module`: The module being loaded.

### Deprecated Usage

Since the `normalModuleLoader` hook is deprecated, you should use the new method as follows:

```javascript
const NormalModule = require('webpack/lib/NormalModule');

class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap('MyPlugin', (compilation) => {
      NormalModule.getCompilationHooks(compilation).loader.tap('MyPlugin', (loaderContext, module) => {
        // Custom logic for the normal module loader
      });
    });
  }
}
```

### Reference to Code Block

The deprecation and the new method are defined in the following code block:

```javascript
const deprecatedNormalModuleLoaderHook = util.deprecate(
  /**
   * @param {Compilation} compilation compilation
   * @returns {NormalModuleCompilationHooks["loader"]} hooks
   */
  compilation => {
    return require("./NormalModule").getCompilationHooks(compilation).loader;
  },
  "Compilation.hooks.normalModuleLoader was moved to NormalModule.getCompilationHooks(compilation).loader",
  "DEP_WEBPACK_COMPILATION_NORMAL_MODULE_LOADER_HOOK"
);
```

This block shows the deprecation warning and the new method to access the loader hooks for normal modules.
